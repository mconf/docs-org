## Mconf

Mconf is a project that aims to create a complete and easy to use web conference system, with focus on the integration with existent platforms and devices and on the interaction with mobile devices.
It is built on top of [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org), an open source web conference system.

Mconf is composed of several components, among them are Mconf-Live, a customized version of BigBlueButton that includes several new features, and Mconf-Web, a web portal where people can collaborate asynchronously, schedule and participate in web conferences.

Mconf started in the end of 2010 as a research project and after years of development Mconf grew to become a solid product. The main distinguishing points compared to other similar systems are (1) the possibility of integrating Mconf with practically any existent system, as shown by the several integrations that already exist (for Moodle and WordPress, for instance), (2) the open source nature of the project, and (3) the wide range of customizations that are possible (when used by an institution, Mconf can be modified to work as part of the institutionâ€™s infrastructure instead of acting as an external, separate web conference system).

The main open source components of Mconf are:

* Mconf-Live, a customized version of BigBlueButton.
* Mconf-Web, a web portal to create web conferences and interact with other people.
* Mconf-Mobile, a mobile client to access web conferences from Android and iOS devices.
