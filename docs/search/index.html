						"content": "→ For the development version of Mconf-Web from the branch master.\n\n→ Mconf-Web uses the rspec framework for automated tests.\n\nRunning the tests\n\nTo run the tests, first you need to set up your development environment. Then you can run the tests with:\n\n$ bundle exec rake\n\n\n\nThis command will erase your entire test database, populate it with the seed data (see db/seeds.rb) and run all tests. It might take some time, but it runs the complete suite of tests to assure that everything is working properly.\n\nAlternatively, you can set up the test database and run single tests to speed up the development.\n\nRun the following command to set up a test database and populate it with the seed data:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:reset\n\n\n\nThen run the tests using the rspec command. The first argument you need to pass to this command is the folder that contains the test files or the files you want to run. You can also specify a single line in a file to run a single test or a block of tests inside a scope.\n\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/                            # run all spec inside the folder spec/\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/                # run all spec inside the folder spec/controllers/\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/models/space_spec.rb        # run all specs in space_spec.rb\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/models/space_spec.rb:40     # run the spec in the line 40 of space_spec.rb\n\n\n\nRun rspec --help for more details.\n\nIt is important to run rspec with bundle exec so that the tests will run using the correct gem environment .\n\nRunning only a few tests\n\nWhen working on specific parts of the code you can save time by running only some tests pertinent to this part. You can run an specific test or an specific block with:\n\n$ bundle exec rspec -l 20 spec/models/user_spec.rb\n\n\n\nThis will run the test or block of tests at line 20 in spec/models/user_spec.rb.\n\nYou can also use tags to identify tests and run just the tests that are tagged. For example:\n\n# tests for a controller method named \"admin\"\ndescribe \"#admin\", :admin =&gt; true do\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\nTo filter the tests that are executed using tags:\n\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/ --tag @admin      # run all tests with the tag 'admin'\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/ --tag ~@abilities # run all except the ones with the tag 'abilities'\n\n\n\nTesting migrations\n\nWe only test migrations that need to alter data in the DB. Simple migrations don’t need to be tested. The instructions here are useful to test a migration before deploying it, but migrations tests don’t need to be executed everytime the test suite is executed.\n\nWe use yaml_db to get the server data and add it to the local database.\nThe test should apply the migration and test if the data was correctly migrated. The server dump should be in the same version of your current database.\n\nThis is a normal workflow to test a migration named 20110101010022_my_migration. The previous migration is the version 20110101010011. The test will only check if the database state is as it should be after the migration.\n\n# rollback to the previous version\n$ bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test VERSION=20110101010011\n\n# dump the database and download it\n# then load the data in your test DB\n$ cap production db:pull\n$ bundle exec rake db:data:load RAILS_ENV=test\n\n# if you need to edit your database to add data that should be tested, do it now\n# and then store the data so that you can load it later to run the test again\n$ bundle exec rake db:data:dump\n\n# migrate to the target version, the migration tested\n$ bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test VERSION=20110101010022\n\n# run the test that will check if the DB is consistent after being migrated\n$ bundle exec rspec spec/migrations/my_migration_spec.rb\n\n\n\nAlso, tag your test with migration_real:\n\ncontext \"using real data\", :migration_real =&gt; true do\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\nNote: Comment the following lines in your spec_helper.rb or your test will not run. We still have to find a better solution for this.\n\nconfig.filter_run_excluding :migration =&gt; true\nconfig.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true"

						"content": "This page is mostly intended for developers, even though users can report deviations from these rules as bugs.\n\nIncludes a collection of best-practices and coding conventions to be followed while writing code for Mconf-Web.\n\nGeneral\n\n\n  Indentation: use 2 spaces for all files: ruby, html, sass, coffeescript, etc.\n\n\nRuby / Rails\n\n\n  Use the following style guide for Ruby: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide\n  Use the following style guide for Rails: https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide\n  Views: Write all views using HAML.\n  Documentation: Use Space and RecentActivity as examples of how to document code.\n\n\nInternationalization\n\n\n  Start by reading the general guide for internationalization on Rails.\n  Try not to use randomly picked translation keys in the locales! Try always to use the default key hierarchy Rails uses to look up for strings. You can find examples in the subsections below.\n\n\nModel names and attributes\n\nTranslate only the fields that are used in the application (some attributes might never appear in any form, for example). The translation doesn’t need to be literal, but should describe the attribute the best way possible.\n\nUsing the default keys Rails looks for in the locales, model names and attributes should be defined as this example:\n\nen:\n  activerecord:\n    models:\n      user: \"User\"\n    attributes:\n      user:\n        full_name: \"Full name\"\n\n\n\nSee this guide for more details.\n\nErrors on models\n\nRails looks for error strings in several places. Any of the following options are good choices:\n\nactiverecord.errors.models.user.attributes.name.blank\nactiverecord.errors.models.user.blank\nactiverecord.errors.messages.blank\n\n\n\nSee this guide for more details.\n\nStrings for Simple Form\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Attribute names should be defined as commented above in [[#model-names-and-attributes\n          Style-Conventions#model-names-and-attributes]]\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Errors should be defined as commented above in [[#errors-on-models\n          Style-Conventions#errors-on-models]]\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Hints are defined in _simple_form.yml:\n\n    en:\n  simple_form:\n    hints:\n      space:\n        public: \"I'm a hint for the attribute public\"\n\n    \n  \n\n\nIf you need something else that doesn’t fit the items above, follow Simple Form’s definitions for I18n.\n\n\n  \n    \n      See more about Simple Form on Mconf-Web at [[#forms\n      Style-Conventions#forms]].\n    \n  \n\n\nLazy lookup\n\nFor other strings, always use lazy lookup inside views. Lazy lookup will force the keys to be organized the way the application is organized.\n\nUsing t('.name') inside the view app/views/user/show.html.erb will look for the string in:\n\nen:\n  users:\n    show:\n      name: \"Name\"\n\n\n\nIf you can’t use lazy lookup, try to organize the keys the same way lazy lookup would organize them. For a string definition inside the method retry in the controller SpacesController, use:\n\nclass SpacesController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def retry\n    ...\n    message = t('spaces.retry.definition')\n    ...\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nen:\n  spaces:\n    retry:\n      definition: \"Definition of a space\"\n\n\n\nGeneric strings\n\nThere are a few very generic strings that can be set only once in the locales, so it doesn’t need to be redefined all the time. For these strings, use the block _other. Examples:\n\nen:\n  _other:\n    create: \"Create\"\n    destroy: \"Destroy\"\n    details: \"Details\"\n    edit: \"Edit\"\n\n\n\nStrings in javascript files\n\nPlace in the block _js. Examples:\n\nen:\n  _js:\n    confirmation_dialog:\n      cancel: \"Cancel\"\n      confirm: \"OK\"\n      title: \"Confirmation\"\n\n\n\nFlash messages\n\nPlace strings used in flash messages under a hierarchy flash:&lt;controller&gt;:&lt;action&gt;. Examples:\n\nen:\n  flash:\n    users:\n      destroy:\n        notice: \"Removed the user\"\n        error: \"Error removing the user\"\n      create:\n        notice: \"Created the user\"\n\n\n\nMigrations\n\nDo not use rails models and their methods in migrations! Avoid this whenever possible. Instead, use the method execute to execute raw SQL.\n\nUsing rails models in migrations is a time bomb: it will work when the migration is developed, but will most likely fail some day in the future (when models are changed or rails is upgraded, for instance). Moreover, raw SQLs will make the migrations a lot faster, specially for big databases.\n\nExample for simple SQLs:\n\ndef up\n  execute \"DELETE FROM bigbluebutton_metadata WHERE owner_type='BigbluebuttonRoom' AND name='mconfweb-title';\"\n  execute \"DELETE FROM bigbluebutton_metadata WHERE owner_type='BigbluebuttonRoom' AND name='mconfweb-description';\"\nend\n\n\n\nExample for selects:\n\ndef up\n  logos = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(\"SELECT * FROM logos\")\n  logos.each do |logo|\n    # logo will be an array, indexed according to how the columns are ordered in the db\n    id = logo[0]\n    name = logo[2]\n    ...\nend\n\n\n\nIf you really, really need to use models, another options is to create fake dummy models inside the migration that include only what is needed of that model. In a migration that generates new logos for profiles, you could have a fake Profile model with something like:\n\nclass MyMigration &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration\n\n  # notice that it is inside the migration class, otherwise it will leak\n  # to all migrations after it\n  class Profile &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n    attr_accessor :crop_x, :crop_y, :crop_w, :crop_h\n    mount_uploader :logo_image, LogoImageUploader\n\n    after_create :crop_avatar\n    after_update :crop_avatar\n\n    def crop_avatar\n      logo_image.recreate_versions! if crop_x.present?\n    end\n  end\n\n  def up\n    profile.logo_image = File.open(\"image.jpg\")\n    profile.save\n  end\n\nend\n\n\n\nMore info about it:\n\n\n  http://complicated-simplicity.com/2010/05/using-models-in-rails-migrations/\n  https://coderwall.com/p/zav1dg\n\n\nForms\n\nWe’re using Simple Form for all forms. You should always use it when creating a new form or editing an old one which isn’t using it yet.\n\nFollow the example below:\n\n  = simple_form_for @space, :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; :put, :class =&gt; 'single-column' } do |f|\n    = f.input :name\n    = f.input :description, :as =&gt; :text, :input_html =&gt; { :rows =&gt; 5 }\n    = f.input :repository\n    = f.input :public, :label =&gt; t('.public')\n    = f.simple_fields_for :bigbluebutton_room do |bbb_room|\n      = bbb_room.input :attendee_password, :as =&gt; :showable_password\n      = bbb_room.input :moderator_password, :as =&gt; :showable_password\n\n\n\nThings to watch out for in the example:\n\n\n  The less code you have, the better. Knowing how Simple Form works will help you dry the code.\n  Most of the times you don’t need to explicitly specify an URL for the form, only something like simple_form_for @space or simple_form_for [@space, @event] will be enough.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          The labels, hints and errors are all set automatically if you define them in the right place in the locale files (see [[#internationalization\n          Style-conventions#internationalization]]). So you can use f.input :name and everything will be set automatically.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  You can set your own strings if necessary, e.g. f.input :public, :label =&gt; t('.public'). In this case it is there because we want a better description of the attribute specifically in this form.\n  There are css classes for different types of forms (e.g. single-column) and custom input types (e.g. showable_password) already defined in the application. Look for other forms as examples before doing your own.\n\n\nModals\n\nWe use bootstrap modals improved by the lib bootstrap-modal. Don’t use them directly, always use the wrapper class mconf.Modal.\n\nTo make a link be opened in a modal window all you need is to set the class open-modal. Example:\n\n= link_to t('.start'), join_options_bigbluebutton_room_path(room),\n   :class =&gt; \"btn btn-primary open-modal\", :'data-modal-width' =&gt; 'small'\n\n\n\nYou can also see the option data-modal-width that forces a different width on the modal. See the comments on mconf.Modal for more information.\n\nThis class can open remote links (like the example above), content already on the page or even receive content via javascript. See mconf.Crop for an example of how it is called from javascript.\n\nIf you need anything that is not provided by mconf.Modal, don’t do it on your view/js only, do it on mconf.Modal so it can be used again later if needed!\n\nConventions for views that open as modals\n\nIf a view will open in a modal window, it should always be a partial. If you want a modal to create a new post, for example, create a view called posts/_new_post and add the following to your controller:\n\ndef new\n  respond_to do |format|\n    format.html {\n      if request.xhr?\n        render :partial =&gt; \"new_post\"\n      else\n        render :new\n      end\n    }\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nThe view posts/new should render posts/_new_post properly adapted to a page that is not a modal. This second view is optional, but it’s a nice idea to always have it so the view is properly rendered either inside or outside a modal.\n\nLinks to join webconferencse\n\nUse the class webconf-join-link, it will make the conference be opened in a proper window. Example:\n\n= link_to t('.join'), invite_bigbluebutton_room_path(room), :class =&gt; \"btn btn-success webconf-join-link\"\n\n\n\nCoffeescript\n\n\n  Use this guide: https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide\n\n\nStylesheets (CSS)\n\n\n  Use lower-case names separated by - for classes names. For example: new-space-list.\n  CSS classes should describe the content, not the look. For example: .user-list is a good name, while .margin-top is bad.\n  Good resources to follow:\n    \n      https://github.com/stevekwan/best-practices/blob/master/css/best-practices.md\n    \n  \n\n\nHTML\n\n\n  Use lower-case names separated by - for IDs. For example: #user-spaces.\n\n\nTests\n\nGeneral\n\n\n  Read about RSpec and best practices. Good resources:\n    \n      http://betterspecs.org/\n    \n  \n  Always add tests to every code you write. If for some reason you can’t, add pending examples for everything you’ve done, they will at least remind us later of what has to be tested.\n\n\nModels\n\nUse the tests for the model Space as an example: https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/spec/models/space_spec.rb\n\nControllers\n\nUse the tests for the controller SpacesController as an example: https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/spec/controllers/spaces_controller_spec.rb\n\nDesign Conventions\n\nThese are basic guidelines about the design, look ‘n feel and the behavior of the web interface of the Mconf Web Portal.\n\nTooltips\n\nHelpful text should be placed in tooltips in the elements where they’re attached or using icons (see the Icons section below). The function options_for_tooltip can be used to create them without worrying too much with the HTML syntax (see an example here).\n\nIcons\n\nIcons are created using functions inside app/helpers/icons_helper.rb. There’s icons for help, more info, comments, news, etc.\n\nYou shouldn’t never need to define a new icon directly in your view. Always define the icon in the helper and then use it in the view. Check the various methods that are already implemented before creating your own.\n\nAll icons use images from font-awesome and boostrap."

A lot was modified in the application and in the server setup and configurations, so read the instructions carefully and be aware that it might take some time to finish all the steps necessary.\n\nIf you have the option to install the application in a brand new server and afterwards migrate your old data to it, we recommend you do it, the migration will probably be easier. To do so, follow the guide at: [[Migrate from 0.8.1 to 2.0 by installing a new server]].\n\nIf you run into any issue during the migration, first take a look at the “migration notes” at the end of this page, you might find the help you need there. If you need help, contact us on our mailing list.\n\nPreparation\n\nBackup!\n\nBackup everything you can before proceeding, it’s the best way to prevent problems. If possible, clone your entire machine and keep it safe in case you need it. If not possible, you should backup at least your database and the application files. More about it in this page.\n\nUpdate your system\n\nMconf-Web now runs over Ubuntu 14.04. If you use an earlier version of Ubuntu, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade it before installing the new version of Mconf-Web.\n\nTo do so, you can use the do-release-upgrade command, see more in this page.\n\nRestart your server\n\nOnce you upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04, restart your server.\n\n$ sudo shutdown -r now\n\n\n\nStop the application\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god terminate\n$ sudo service apache2 stop\n\n\n\nMigration\n\nExecute the steps below in the order they appear in this guide.\n\nInstall new packages\n\n\n  \n    \n      Install all packages needed by the new version of Mconf-Web following the section “[[System Packages\n      Deployment#system-packages]]” of the installation manual.\n    \n  \n\n\nReplace RVM by rbenv\n\nMconf-Web now recommends the use of rbenv instead of RVM to install and use ruby.\n\nAt first, remove RVM and everything related to it:\n\n$ rvm implode --force\n\n\n\nThe command above might show a few warnings that some files could not be removed. If it does, remove these files yourself.\n\nIf you need more help to remove RVM, there is plenty of information in the Internet. Here are some examples of pages that can help you:\n\n\n  https://coderwall.com/p/kzlweq\n  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3558656/how-can-i-remove-rvm-ruby-version-manager-from-my-system\n  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3950260/howto-uninstall-rvm\n\n\nAfter removing RVM, restart your terminal!\n\n\n  \n    \n      Once RVM is properly removed, proceed to the standard installation of rbenv, ruby and bundler, as shown in the section “[[Ruby\n      Deployment#ruby]]” of the installation guide.\n    \n  \n\n\nUpdate the code to the new version\n\nWarning: The commands below will remove any local changes you might have done in your application files. If you did change anything, backup your changes first!\n\n# cd into your application directory:\n$ cd ~/mconf-web/current\n\n$ git fetch --all\n$ git checkout v2.0.0\n$ git reset --hard origin/v2.0.0\n\n\n\nMove the application to /var/www/mconf-web/\n\nPreviously Mconf-Web was by default installed at ~/mconf-web/current/. Now this path changed to /var/www/mconf-web/current/. We still assume you are deploying using a user named mconf.\n\nMove it and make sure you user has permission to access it:\n\n$ sudo mv ~/mconf-web /var/www/\n$ sudo chown -R mconf:www-data /var/www/mconf-web\n\n\n\nIf you have any symbolic links inside the folder mconf-web, remember that you will have to recreate them!\n\nMake sure the folders that are used to upload content have permissions that allow it:\n\n$ sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/mconf-web/current/public/logos\n$ sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/mconf-web/current/public/uploads\n$ sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/mconf-web/current/private/uploads\n\n\n\nThere are still several configurations that have to be updated to point to this new application path. This will be done in the following sections.\n\nUpdate all dependencies\n\nFirst remove a git submodule that is now installed as a gem:\n\n$ cd /var/www/mconf-web/current\n$ rm -fr .git/modules/vendor/\n$ rm -fr vendor/plugins/station/\n\n\n\nRemove the following lines from the file .git/config:\n\n[submodule \"vendor/plugins/station\"]\n    url = git://github.com/mconf/station.git\n\n\n\nOpen the file .bundle/config and check if it has an entry pointing to the old application path (~/mconf-web/current). If it does, change it to the new path /var/www/mconf-web/current and save the file.\n\nInstall the gems:\n\n$ bundle install --without=development test\n\n\n\nUpdate your configuration files\n\nThe format of the config/setup_conf.yml file has changed. Open your file and the new example file and compare them. Change the structure of your file to be like the new example file.\n\n\n  \n    \n      You can find more information about it [[in this page\n      Configuration-Files]].\n    \n  \n\n\nUpdate the database\n\n\n  \n    \n      This is a very important and delicate step in the migration. We recommend [[you backup your database first\n      Deployment-v0.8#backup]] if you didn’t do it yet, so if anything goes wrong you can recover it, solve the errors and try to migrate again.\n    \n  \n\n\nWe will also store the output of this migration into db-migration.txt, so you can look at it later on if needed. The command will also output what is happening in your console, so keep an eye open to possible errors in the migration.\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate | tee db-migration.txt\n\n\n\nThis migration was tested with different databases with a lot of data in them. But it is always possible that your database will have something unexpected that can break the migration or generate inconsistent data. So keep the db-migration.txt for as long as you can, so you can look at it later if needed.\n\nCompile the assets\n\nThis will compile all assets (javascripts and stylesheets) that are used by the clients. It usually takes a few minutes to complete.\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile\n\n\n\nUpdate Passenger and Apache’s configurations\n\nFirst remove the old version of Passenger:\n\n# if you removed RVM you don't need this next command, all gems have already been removed\n$ gem uninstall passenger\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Then install Passenger and its module for Apache again, following [[this page\n      Deployment#web-server].\n    \n  \n\n\nWith the new version of Passenger installed, you just have to check Apache’s configuration files.\n\nEdit the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web and, if you enabled HTTPS, the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web-ssl. The references to the old application path should be updated to /var/www/mconf-web/current.\n\nAlso verify if your configuration files are similar to the examples we have for Mconf-Web:\n\n\n  If using Mconf-Web on port 80, without SSL: this file\n  If using Mconf-Web on port 443, with SSL: this file for port 80, this file for port 443\n  If using Mconf-Web with Shibboleth: this file\n\n\nUpdate Logrotate\n\nRemove the old configuration file:\n\n$ sudo rm /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Install it again [[following the updated guide\n      Deployment#logrotate]].\n    \n  \n\n\nClean the crontab (whenever was removed)\n\nWhenever is a dependency that is not used anymore. It changed your crontab and you won’t need these changes anymore, so you should remove them.\n\nOpen you crontab for edition with:\n\n$ crontab -e\n\n\n\nRemove everything in between the marks that Whenever added:\n\n# Begin Whenever generated tasks for: mconf-web\n\n...\n\n# End Whenever generated tasks for: mconf-web\n\n\n\nClose the file and your crontab will be updated. To check if everything is ok, you can output its content with:\n\ncrontab -l\n\n\n\nReplace God by Monit\n\nRemove God (be carefull, it will remove all files associated with God!):\n\n# if you removed RVM you don't need this next command, all gems have already been removed\n$ gem uninstall god\n\n$ sudo rm -r /etc/god/\n$ sudo update-rc.d -f god remove\n$ sudo rm /etc/init.d/god\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Install and configure Monit [[following this guide\n      Deployment#monit]].\n    \n  \n\n\nUpdate the recordings\n\nThe structures in which recordings are stored in the database changed, so we need to fetch recordings again from the web conference servers to update the database. This will automatically be done periodically, but you should force an update now to prevent problems.\n\n$ cd /var/www/mconf-web/current\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake bigbluebutton_rails:recordings:update\n\n\n\nDatabase consistency\n\nSome changes in how models are validated might have made some data in your database inconsistent. You can check possible inconsistencies with:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:check_sanity\n\n\n\nIf there are inconsistencies, you can run another rake task that we created to help you fix them:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:sanify\n\n\n\nThis task will search for some common types of inconsistencies and propose a solution to fix them. For each inconsistency found, you can decide whether you want to apply the proposed solution or not. If this task doesn’t solve all inconsistencies found, you will have to solve them manually using the Rails console or directly on MySQL’s console.\n\nFinal cleanup\n\nWhen you migrated the database, logos, avatars and attachments were moved to new directories, but the old ones were left where they were. You can now remove them or move them somewhere else:\n\n$ rm -r /var/www/mconf-web/current/attachments\n$ rm -r /var/www/mconf-web/current/public/logos\n\n\n\nRestart and test it\n\nRestart your server and, once it comes back, you will be able to access your new version of Mconf-Web.\n\nConfigure\n\nThere are new configuration options available in the new version of Mconf-Web that will require your attention. Once you sign in, take some time to visit the management page and look at all the options available.\n\nMigration notes\n\nMore information that might help you with the migration:\n\n\n  All logos will be moved to a new folder: public/uploads/, but the old folder will still be there at /public/logos/.\n  Attachments were moved from attachments/ to /private/uploads/attachments/. There’s a migration to migrate from the old files to the new ones that will make the database consistent, but will not remove obsolete attachments from the disk. The migration has a lot of output messages to indicate attachments that are being removed. Search for the string “attachment being removed from the database (but not from the disk!)” when migrating the database if you want to know the files that can be removed.\n  To find possible errors when migrating the logos, search for the string: error saving the target:. You shouldn’t worry about the warnings WARN: Migration found a logo without a proper owner, logo will be lost they are normal (the same logos were stored in several files, one for each resolution; most of them are ignored in the migration, generating this warning).\n  The database migration might take some long minutes to finish, depending on how big is your database. The slowest steps are usually these: GenerateNewLogos, RemoveMetadataFromRooms, MigrateEventsToMwebEvents, CreateRecentActivities, and GenerateNewAttachments."

						"content": "This guide will show you how to migrate from Mconf-Web 0.8.1 to Mconf-Web 2.0 by installing a new server with Mconf-Web 2.0 and migrating the data from the old server to the new server server. So the first step in this guide is to create a new server where your new Mconf-Web will be installed. If, for any reason, you can’t create a new server and just wish to update your current server, follow this guide: [[Migrate from 0.8.1 to 2.0 by upgrading your server]].\n\nA lot changed in the application and in the server setup and configurations, so read the instructions carefully and be aware that it might take some time to finish all the steps necessary.\n\nThis guide assumes you don’t have any type of customization in your server. If you did change anything (e.g. Apache’s configurations), you will need to migrate these changes yourself.\n\nFirst step: Install Mconf-Web 2.0\n\nThe first step is to install a new version of Mconf-Web 2.0 in a new server. The process is exactly the same as if you were just setting up a new server, so follow the standard installation instructions at: [[Deployment]].\n\nSecond step: Migrate data and files\n\nIn this step you will copy the files and the data on your old server’s database to the new server.\n\nCopying the database\n\nDump the database to a file in the old server:\n\n$ mysqldump -u root -p mconf_production &gt; ~/mconf_production.sql\n# it will ask you for MySQL's root password\n\n\n\nCopy the file to the new server. You can use scp or any other similar command:\n\n$ ssh mconf@new-server.com\n$ scp mconf@old-server.com:~/mconf_production.sql .\n\n\n\nDrop the database in your new server to prevent conflicts with the data that will be imported:\n\n$ cd /var/www/mconf-web/current\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:drop\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:create\n\n\n\nImport the database dump into your new server’s database:\n\n$ mysql -u root -p mconf_production &lt; mconf_production.sql\n# it will ask you for MySQL's root password\n\n\n\nCopy the files\n\nAll files uploaded by users to your old server need to be copied to the new server. The folders you need to copy are attachments and public/logos, including everything inside them. To do so, you can use commands similar to the ones below:\n\n# signed into your new server, run:\n$ rsync -ru --progress mconf@old-server.com:/var/www/mconf-web/current/attachments /var/www/mconf-web/current/\n$ rsync -ru --progress mconf@old-server.com:/var/www/mconf-web/current/public/logos /var/www/mconf-web/current/public/\n\n\n\nMigrate the database\n\nSince you imported the database from your old server, your current database is in the format used by Mconf-Web 0.8.1, so you will need to update it. This should be done only after you have all the files properly copied to the new server, since this update will also change file names and folders to adapt them to Mconf-Web 2.0.\n\n$ cd /var/www/mconf-web/current\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate | tee db-migration.log\n\n\n\nThird step: Cleanup\n\nUpdate the recordings\n\nThe structures in which recordings are stored in the database changed, so we need to fetch recordings again from the web conference servers to update the database. This will automatically be done periodically, but you should force an update now to prevent problems.\n\n$ cd /var/www/mconf-web/current\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake bigbluebutton_rails:recordings:update\n\n\n\nDatabase consistency\n\nSome changes in how models are validated might have made some data in your database inconsistent. You can check possible inconsistencies with:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:check_sanity\n\n\n\nIf there are inconsistencies, you can run another rake task that we created to help you fix them:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:sanify\n\n\n\nThis task will search for some common types of inconsistencies and propose a solution to fix them.

If this task doesn’t solve all inconsistencies found, you will have to solve them manually using the Rails console or directly on MySQL’s console.\n\nFinal cleanup\n\nWhen you migrated the database, logos, avatars and attachments were moved to new directories, but the old ones were left where they were. You can now remove them or move them somewhere else:\n\n$ rm -r /var/www/mconf-web/current/attachments\n$ rm -r /var/www/mconf-web/current/public/logos\n\n\n\nRestart and test it\n\nRestart your server and, once it comes back, you will be able to access your new version of Mconf-Web.\n\nConfigure\n\nThere are new configuration options available in the new version of Mconf-Web that will require your attention.

						"content": "→ For the development version of Mconf-Web from the branch master.\n\n→ This version uses uses Rails 4 and Ruby 2.2.5.\n\nSetting up the development environment\n\nInitial setup\n\n\n  First, you need to install some system packages used by Mconf-Web:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install wget make curl git-core libruby aspell-es aspell-en libxml2-dev \\\n        libxslt1-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev imagemagick libmysqlclient-dev \\\n        mysql-server zlib1g-dev build-essential libqtwebkit-dev libreadline-dev \\\n        libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev redis-server \n\n\n\n\n  \n    Then install Ruby. We recommend the use of rbenv. You can see below the commands to install everything you need, but first please look at the links pointed below to learn what those tools are used for and how they work:\n\n    \n      rbenv’s README file describes what it is and has instructions on how to install it\n      ruby-build is a plugin for rbenv used to install rubies.\n    \n\n    (Note that if you have RVM installed, you should remove it first!)\n  \n\n\n# Install rbenv\n$ git clone git://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv\n$ echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n$ echo 'eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n# install ruby build\n$ git clone git://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build\n# install ruby\n$ rbenv install 2.2.5\n$ rbenv rehash\n# set this version of ruby as the default (optional) and check it is correct\n$ rbenv global 2.2.5\n$ rbenv version # &gt; 2.2.5 (set by /home/mconf/.rbenv/version)\n# install bundler\n$ gem install bundler -v '1.3.5'\n$ rbenv rehash\n\n\n\n\n  Clone mconf-web:\n\n\n$ git clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git\n\n\n\n\n  Install the dependencies:\n\n\n$ bundle install\n\n\n\n\n  Open MySQL’s console (mysql -u root -p) to setup your MySQL user and password:\n\n\n# change the passwords in the commands below!\nCREATE USER \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_development.* TO \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_test.* TO \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n\n\n  Configuration files. You need to create and edit the files below. They don’t exist yet in your repository, but they all have example files in the same directory that can be copied and used. The files are:\n    \n      config/database.yml: Configures the database. Use the user mconf and the password you configured on MySQL in the step below. See this page for more details about it.\n      config/setup_conf.yml: Contains the basic configuration data that will be used during the database setup and when the application is initialized. See this page for more details about it.\n    \n  \n  Setup the database. It will drop and recreate your development database and create the seeding data you need to run the application.\n\n\n$ bundle exec rake db:setup\n\n\n\n\n  Run the command below to start the server:\n\n\n$ bundle exec rails server\n\n\n\n\n  Open your browser and go to localhost:3000 to access the application. Log in with the admin user you configured on you setup_conf.yml.\n\n\nFake test data\n\nYou can create fake data in your development database using the following rake task:\n\n$ bundle exec rake db:populate\n\n\n\nRe-creating the database\n\nThe easiest way to empty your database and start over again is running the tasks below:\n\n$ bundle exec rake db:reset\n\n\n\nIf you get an error saying that your database is at the wrong version, just run db:migrate once and then try the commands above once again and they should work.\n\nTesting\n\nSee this page.\n\nConfiguring the website\n\nMconf-Web stores all its configurations in a database and provides a management interface in the website where the admin user can edit most of these configurations. See this page for more details.\n\nAlso, the configurations that can be edited in the management interface can also be configured using the file config/setup_conf.yml. See this page for more details on how it works.\n\nDevelopment tips\n\nSending emails in development\n\nE-mails are sent by resque and scheduled by resque-scheduler, so you must run the scheduler and (at least) one resque worker:\n\n$ QUEUE=\"*\" bundle exec rake resque:work\n$ bundle exec rake resque:scheduler\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to set your SMTP configurations in the application. And when you modify it, don’t forget to restart the web server and all resque processes.\n\nTesting and modifying emails: MailCatcher\n\nMailCatcher is a gem used to “capture” emails and shows them in a simple interface. Very useful when modifying emails in development.\n\nInstall it:\n\n$ bundle install\n$ rbenv rehash\n\n\n\nRun it:\n\n$ mailcatcher\n\n\n\nFrom inside a VM set up with Vagrant, run it with:\n\n$ mailcatcher --http-ip=0.0.0.0\n\n\n\nConfigure the application with the following SMTP configurations:\n\n\n  SMTP sender: anything, as long as it’s a valid e-mail\n  SMTP domain: localhost\n  SMTP port: 1025\n  Leave all the other SMTP options blank.\n\n\nRun the resque workers and the scheduler as described in this section.\n\nNow all emails sent by Mconf-Web will go to the SMTP server created by MailCatcher and will be available on its interface at http://localhost:1080/.\n\nUpdating the list of meetings:\n\nMeetings in Mconf-Web are instances of the model BigbluebuttonMeeting.\n\nBigbluebuttonRails uses resque to schedule workers that will created meetings when a user joins a room. These workers run in background, and need resque to be triggered for then to actually work:\n\n$ rake resque:work QUEUE='*'\n\n\n\nRead more at BigbluebuttonRails README.\n\nUsing a fake LDAP server on development\n\nThere’s a rake task called ldap:server which after invoked starts a LDAP server in localhost with the same config options as the ones in your database.\n\n$ bundle exec rake ldap:setup_site # configure the LDAP attributes in your site\n$ bundle exec rake ldap:server\n\n\n\nBy default there’s only one registered user with login mconf-user and password mconf.\n\nYou can supply a port number with:\n\n$ bundle exec rake ldap:server[4141]\n\n\n\nIf not present it will use the port configured for the website or 1389.\n\nRecommended site configurations:\n\n\n  LDAP: Enable authentication: –check–\n  LDAP: Server IP or domain: localhost\n  LDAP: Server port: 1389\n  LDAP: Full DN or user to bind: cn=admin,cn=TOPLEVEL,dc=example,dc=com\n  LDAP: Password to connect: admin\n  LDAP: Full DN for the users tree: ou=USERS,dc=example,dc=com\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the username: uid\n  LDAP: Field for principal name (unique ID): mail\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user’s email: mail\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user’s full name: cn\n\n\nUsing ruby with rbenv\n\nYou can easily replace RVM by rbenv.\n\nFirst make sure you remove RVM (rvm implode) and all references to it. Then install rbenv following the guide at their GitHub page.\n\nInstall the target ruby (check on .ruby-version the version you should install):\n\n$ rbenv install 1.9.2-p290\n$ rbenv rehash\n\n\n\nInstall bundler:\n\n$ gem install bundler\n\n\n\nAnd then use bundle exec always when running ruby commands, for example:\n\n$ bundle exec rake db:migrate\n$ bundle exec rails server\n\n\n\nrbenv has no gemsets as used in RVM, so you bundler is used to keep track of the gems and the versions that should be used."

						"content": "→ For Mconf-Web version 0.8.\n\nThis is a step-by-step guide showing every detail needed to install Mconf-Web 0.8. If you have experience deploying a Rails application this guide should look very familiar to you.\n\nMconf-Web is developed in and targeted to Ubuntu systems. We recommend the use of an specific version of Ubuntu (see below), but it has been tested in newer versions and should work as well (however some instructions might have to be adapted).\n\nThe recommended setup for this version of Mconf-Web is:\n\n\n  Ubuntu 12.04 operating system with a user named mconf.\n  Ruby is installed with RVM.\n  Phusion Passenger (ruby app server).\n  Apache (but you can also use Nginx).\n  MySQL database.\n\n\nThis guide will instruct you on how to setup this environment.\n\nMconf-Web can also be adapted to your needs. It is a Ruby on Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application. It should work on any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do). But be aware that changing any of these components will probably require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes).\n\nInstalling Mconf-Web\n\nSystem Packages\n\nYou need to install some system packages before you can run Mconf-web in production:\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install curl make git-core libruby aspell-es aspell-en \\\n                       libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libmagickcore-dev \\\n                       libmagickwand-dev imagemagick libmysqlclient-dev \\\n                       mysql-server zlib1g-dev build-essential \\\n                       libreadline-dev nfs-common libcurl4-openssl-dev\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to type a password for MySQL’s root user in case you don’t MySQL installed yet.\n\nRuby\n\nMconf-web uses Ruby 1.9.2 (p290). To install Ruby, we suggest the use of RVM (that’s how we install ruby in development and production). But you have other options:\n\n\n  Using RVM (recommended): See this page. RVM can be installed as single-user or multi-user. For a production environment it is recommended to use the multi-user installation.\n  Using apt packages: Ruby can also be installed using apt packages in Ubuntu, but unfortunately they are out of date. Installing ruby 1.9.2 would actually install version 1.9.2-p0 instead of 1.9.2-p290. BigBlueButton 0.8 uses a nice script to compile ruby from source and install it as a package that you can see here.\n  From source: You can also download and install ruby manually, similarly to what’s done in the script used by BigBlueButton but skipping the packaging. Make sure you use version 1.9.2-p290.\n\n\nFrom now on, we will assume you will install ruby with RVM, so if you decide for another method you might have to adapt some commands.\n\nTo install RVM run:\n\n$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable --without-gems=\"bundler\"\n\n\n\nThis will install the latest version of RVM skipping the gem bundler. We skip it because we need to install an specific version later on. In case you have any problems refer to RVM’s documentation at https://rvm.io/rvm/install/.\n\nThe first thing after the installation is to add your user to the rvm group:\n\n$ sudo adduser mconf rvm # change \"mconf\" to your username\n\n\n\nAfter that, restart your terminal! If you don’t do that, RVM won’t be found and your user’s permissions won’t be updated.\n\nBefore installing ruby, run the command below to see the dependencies RVM requires you to install before ruby. It will show you a apt-get command right below the header “For Ruby / Ruby HEAD (MRI, Rubinius, &amp; REE)”. Install the packages listed there before proceeding.\n\n$ rvm requirements\n\n\n\nInstall ruby and create a gemset for Mconf-web:\n\n$ rvm install 1.9.2-p290\n# if you get a \"checksum error\", run this command again with:\n#   rvm reinstall 1.9.2-p290 --verify-downloads 1\n\n$ rvm gemset create mconf\n$ rvm use --default 1.9.2-p290@mconf\n\n\n\nThen install bundler in the gemset global to be available to all other gemsets:\n\n$ rvm use 1.9.2-p290@global\n$ gem install bundler -v 1.3.4\n$ rvm use 1.9.2-p290@mconf\n\n\n\nDownload the application\n\nInstall git if you don’t have it and clone Mconf-Web:\n\n$ mkdir -p ~/mconf-web/current/\n$ git clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git ~/mconf-web/current/\n\n\n\nYour application will be deployed at ~/mconf-web/current/, but you can change it if you need to. It is the default path, so it should require less configurations if you don’t change it.\n\nThe first thing is to mark the .rvmrc as trusted (you can read more about here). This is specially useful later on when other processes are executed (god and delayed_job) and needs this to be done:\n\n$ rvm rvmrc trust ~/mconf-web/current/.rvmrc\n\n\n\nNext, change your repository to the version you will be deploying:\n\n$ cd ~/mconf-web/current\n$ git checkout v0.8.1\n\n\n\nWith the repository you can now install the dependencies. All dependencies are either gems (and are listed in the Gemfile) or submodules. Run the commands below:\n\n$ git submodule init\n$ git submodule update\n$ bundle install --without=development test\n\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\nThere are two files that need to be configured. At first, copy the example files:\n\n$ cp ~/mconf-web/current/config/setup_conf.yml.example ~/mconf-web/current/config/setup_conf.yml\n$ cp ~/mconf-web/current/config/database.yml.example ~/mconf-web/current/config/database.yml\n\n\n\nSee below what you have to edit in setup_conf.yml and database.yml:\n\n\n  \n    database.yml configures the database and it must be configured now. By default, MySQL will be used. You only need to set the variables username and password (for all environments) with the user that will be used to access MySQL and his password. We recommend a user other than root (usually mconf). See the section 4.1. below how to create this user.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          setup_conf.yml has general configurations for the web application and it’s optional right now: if you don’t edit it now you can edit its properties from Mconf-Web’s interface (see [[this page\n          Configuring-the-Website-v0.8]]). Note: if you don’t edit this file, by default the administrator account will use the email admin@default.com, login admin and password admin.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      To learn more about the other options in these files, see [[this page\n      Configuration-Files-v0.8]].\n    \n  \n\n\nDatabase user\n\nThis section explains how to create a database user named mconf and give him access to the databases used by Mconf-Web.\n\nFirst open MySQL’s console (you will have to enter the password for the root user):\n\n$ mysql -u root -p\n\n\n\n(If you’re having trouble with the root password in MySQL, see this FAQ entry.)\n\nThen create the user (change all occurrences of password by the actual password that should be used):\n\nCREATE USER \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_production.* TO \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n\nApplication configurations\n\nThis step consists of everything that was not possible to be done before because we needed the configuration files properly edited.\n\nWe’ll setup the database and generate a new secret key for rails.\n\n(These commands will drop your old database (if any) and create a new one, empty. Be careful if you’re running it again after using the application.)\n\n$ cd ~/mconf-web/current\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:reset\n$ sed -i \"s/secret_token =.*/secret_token = '`RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake secret | sed -n 2p`'/g\" ./config/initializers/secret_token.rb\n\n\n\nWeb server\n\nMconf-Web uses Apache and Passenger to serve the application.\n\nInstall Passenger (it’s a ruby gem) and its module for Apache. Passenger has a nice installer that will compile the Apache module and install it for you. If some dependency is missing it will warn you and help you install it. Run the following commands:\n\n$ gem install passenger -v 3.0.11    # this version is also defined in the Gemfile\n$ passenger-install-apache2-module\n\n\n\n(In case passenger-install-apache2-module is not found, look for it at /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@mconf/bin/ and use its full path in the command above.)\n\nThe application passenger-install-apache2-module is interactive and has the following steps:\n\n\n  Check for dependencies: If your system is missing any required software, it will warn you and tell you how to install them. You have to install all packages suggested! Simply exit the passenger installer, install the packages and then run the passenger installer again; If it asks you to install Rake, do so with gem install rake -v '0.8.7'.\n  Automatically compile and install the module for Apache;\n  It will show you some lines that must be added the you Apache configuration file. Ignore this for now, the next step of this guide will show you how to configure it.\n  In the last step it will give you an example of how to deploy an application. Ignore the example for now, the next step of this guide will show you the specific configurations for Mconf-web.\n\n\nSee more about Passenger at their website and check this video to see more about how it can be used with Apache.\n\nApache configurations\n\nBy default Apache is installed at /etc/apache2/ and it’s configuration file will be at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.\nYou can add configuration files at /etc/apache2/conf.d/ and sites at /etc/apache2/sites-available/.\n\nAt first, enable the Passenger module in Apache with:\n\n$ passenger-install-apache2-module --snippet | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf.d/mconf-passenger\n\n\n\nThis will create a new configuration file with the Passenger module snippet, the same block Passenger showed you in the item 3 in the previous section.\n\nNext, we enable the rewrite module in Apache and remove any default site that might exist:\n\n$ sudo a2enmod rewrite\n$ sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*\n\n\n\nNow you need to add a configuration file for Mconf-Web. You might just download our example and edit it:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v0.8.1/config/webserver/apache2.example -O /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web\n\n\n\nThe file will be saved at /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web. This is the content of this file:\n\n&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n\n  # Shows the maintenance page if it exists\n  ErrorDocument 503 /system/maintenance.html\n  RewriteEngine On\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\\.(css|gif|jpg|png)$\n  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/system/maintenance.html -f\n  RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !maintenance.html\n  RewriteRule ^.*$  -  [redirect=503,last]\n\n  ServerName YOUR_HOST\n  DocumentRoot /YOUR_MCONF_WEB/public\n  &lt;Directory /YOUR_MCONF_WEB/public&gt;\n    AllowOverride all\n    Options -MultiViews\n  &lt;/Directory&gt;\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should change YOUR_HOST by your IP or domain and /YOUR_MCONF_WEB/public (both occurrences) to the path to your Mconf-Web application, that should be /home/mconf/mconf-web/current/public (don’t forget to point to the public directory!).\n\nAfter editing the file, enable it in Apache with:\n\n$ sudo a2ensite mconf-web\n\n\n\nAt last, restart Apache and it should be ready to serve Mconf-Web:\n\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\nAfter installing and configuring Apache and Passenger, you should already be able to access your application in your browser!\n\nGod (monitoring tool)\n\nGod is a process monitoring framework that Mconf-Web uses to monitor other processes. It is installed as a system-wide application and configured as such. God should be always running, just like your web server will always be running.\n\nInstall God and create an RVM wrapper for it, so that it runs with the correct environment setup:\n\n$ cd ~/mconf-web/current\n$ gem install god -v 0.12.1 # this version is also defined in the Gemfile\n$ rvm wrapper 1.9.2-p290@mconf bootup god\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll create a configuration file for god at /etc/god/config. This file will simply load any other configuration file in the folder /etc/god/conf.d/, that will also be created.\n\n$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/god/conf.d/\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v0.8.1/config/god/config -O /etc/god/config\n\n\n\nGod is currently used to monitor the process delayed_job (used to deliver emails, mostly). So you need to install God’s configuration file for delayed_job:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v0.8.1/config/god/delayed_job.god -O /etc/god/conf.d/delayed_job.god\n\n\n\nThis file has a line that points to Mconf-Web’s path, so it should be edited to match the path where you will place Mconf-Web. If Mconf-Web is at /home/mconf/mconf-web/current you don’t need to do anything!\n\nOtherwise, edit the file with your favorite editor or use the following command to edit it (replace %PATH% with the actual path):\n\n$ sudo sed -i 's:^RAILS_ROOT =.*:RAILS_ROOT = \"%PATH%\":g' /etc/god/conf.d/delayed_job.god\n\n# example:\n$ sudo sed -i 's:^RAILS_ROOT =.*:RAILS_ROOT = \"/home/mconf/mconf-web/current\":g' /etc/god/conf.d/delayed_job.god\n\n\n\nRead the next section to see how to start God.\n\nManaging God: start, stop, status\n\nTo start and stop God, we’ll install an init script in /etc/init.d/:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v0.8.1/config/god/init_script -O /etc/init.d/god\n$ sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/god\n$ sudo update-rc.d god defaults\n\n\n\nThis script is already configured to load the configuration file /etc/god/config and save the log at /var/log/god.log. The pid file will be at GOD_PID=/var/run/god.pid.\n\nThen you can start/stop god with:\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god {start|stop|terminate|restart|status}\n\n\n\nStart it, check if it’s running. If not, check the messages in the log file:\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god start\n$ ps aux | grep god\n\n\n\nThe ps command above should show a process similar to:\n\nroot     28309  9.5  4.2  35808 21380 pts/0    Sl   15:02   0:01 /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@mconf/bin/god\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to mention that God has two stop commands: stop and terminate. Using stop will finish only God’s process, but all monitored processes will not be finished, they will just become unmonitored. The command terminate however will stop God and all the monitored processes. terminate is usually more useful since it will force processes like delayed_job to be finished and then restarted when God is restarted, and this is usually what the user expects when he stops God.\n\nUpdating God to another version\n\nFirst stop it and uninstall the old version:\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god terminate\n$ gem uninstall god\n\n\n\nThen run the commands listed in the top of this section to install the new version of god and to create the rvm wrapper.\n\nMake sure the new God is installed, checking the version with:\n\n$ bootup_god -v\n\n\n\nStart it again\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god start\n\n\n\nWhenever\n\nWhenever is a gem that helps you configure the crontab. The tasks are specified in the file config/schedule.rb and then Whenever is used to generate the crontab.\n\nThe gem Whenever will already be installed with the other gems when you run bundle install, so you just need to use it.\n\nUpdating the crontab\n\nTo update the crontab, go to your Mconf-Web directory and run the comman below. It will not override your crontab, only update it with Mconf-Web’s entries.\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec whenever --update-crontab\n\n\n\nThen look at your crontab with the command below to check if was actually updated:\n\n$ crontab -l\n\n\n\nWhenever with RVM\n\nWhen using Whenever with RVM, you should add the following line to your ~/.rvmrc. If the file doesn’t exist, create it.\n\nrvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1\n\n\n\nThis prevents cron tasks from failing when trying to read the .rvmrc files. For more information check Whenever’s readme file.\n\nLogrotate\n\nLogrotate is a utility that prevents logs from getting to big creating new files and compacting the old ones.\n\nYou server should already have it installed, but if it doesn’t, install it with:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install logrotate\n\n\n\nThe configuration file for logrotate can be copied from Mconf-Web’s repository with:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v0.8.1/config/logrotate/mconf-web -O /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n\n\n\nIf you have Mconf-Web installed in a path other than /home/mconf/mconf-web/current, you will have to edit the  application path in the configuration file above.\n\nThen set the permissions and activate logrotate:\n\n$ sudo chown root:root /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n$ sudo logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/status /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n\n\n\nIf the last command doesn’t print any errors, it should be working. Check the log folder inside your Mconf-Web to see if the log files have been changed.\n\nDone!\n\n\n  \n    \n      At this point you finished installing Mconf-Web. The first thing you might want to do is [[configure the application\n      Configuring-the-Website-v0.8]].\n    \n  \n\n\nMaintenance tasks\n\nRestart\n\nTo restart the application you need to restart the web server and god:\n\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god terminate\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god start\n\n\n\nThe web server you’ll need to restart every time you change anything in the application (source code) or configuration files.\n\nYou don’t always need to restart god, only if you changed anything in its configuration files or in files that the monitored processes use (for example, if you change the Gmail account settings used to send emails). If you’re not sure, restart it. Also, we use the action “terminate” so that god will also stop all monitored processes before stopping itself. It will, for instance, stop delayed_job  (a gem used to send emails) and then, when god is restarted, delayed_job will also be restarted (and so your new configurations will be applied).\n\nBackup\n\nThe most important backup you need is your database. If you’re using MySQL, you can use the following commands to backup (and restore) the database used by Mconf-Web:\n\n# backup\n$ mysqldump -u root -p mconf_production &gt; mconf_production-`date +%F`.sql\n\n# restore\n$ mysql -u root -p mconf_production &lt; mconf_production-2011-06-21.sql\n\n\n\nThere are also files that are not stored in the database, such as user images and attachments. And you also might want to backup your log files.\n\nSo make sure you backup the files in the following folders:\n\n(...)/mconf-web/attachments/\n(...)/mconf-web/public/logos/\n(...)/mconf-web/log/\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nFollow the steps below to update from minor versions of 0.8 (e.g. from 0.8 to 0.8.1). Do not use it for versions other than 0.8.\n\nAt first, update your repository and checkout the version you want:\n\n$ cd ~/mconf-web/current\n$ git pull\n$ git checkout v0.8.1\n\n\n\nUpdate the dependencies:\n\n$ git submodule update\n$ bundle install --without=development test\n\n\n\nMigrate the database:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate\n\n\n\nUpdate the crontab:\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec whenever --update-crontab\n\n\n\nThere are also other files that might need to be updated, such as the configuration files for god, that will not be configured with the commands above. To check if you need to do any extra work, check the update notes in the changelog.\n\nRestart the web server as described previously."

It connects to a Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton server (works with both applications) and allows users to create and participate in web conferences. It provides features that are (by design) not implemented in the core of Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton, such as:\n\n\n  User authentication;\n  Permission control to access web conference rooms;\n  Users can create and join spaces (communities) to interact;\n  Users have their own web conferences that they can share with other members or even invite people that do not have an account;\n  Spaces also have a web conference room that its members can use to interact.\n\n\nTry it!\n\nMconf-Web can be tested at: http://mconf.org/. This server is free for everyone to register and use to explore Mconf.\n\nIntegration with Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton\n\nMconf-Web will always support the latest version of Mconf-Live. As for BigBlueButton, it currently supports versions 0.8 (and 0.81), 0.9.0 (and 0.9.1) and 1.0. Since the changes in BigBlueButton’s API are usually backwards compatible, Mconf-Web will possibly also support newer versions of BigBlueButton as they are released, even if they are not listed here.\n\nThe integration with Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton is based on two gems:\n\n\n  bigbluebutton-api-ruby: A library to access Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton’s API in Ruby applications.\n  bigbluebutton_rails: An integration of BigBlueButton and Rails. It uses bigbluebutton-api-ruby to access BigBlueButton’s API.\n\n\nHow to Start\n\nFor developers:\n\n\n  Learn how to setup a development environment\n  And then how to test the application\n\n\nTo install Mconf-Web on a server:\n\n\n  Install the latest stable version\n\n\nMore:\n\n\n  Releases\n  Changelog\n  Want to translate Mconf-Web to another language?\n\n\nGlobal Plaza\n\nMconf-Web started as a fork of VCC, an open source system that can be found here. VCC, also known as Global Plaza, is a project developed in Ruby on Rails to provide a virtual event service for the Internet. It uses the Isabel system to provide webconferencing.\n\nThe project supporting VCC has ended in the end of 2010, so it’s development has been stopped since then. You can find the Global Plaza project running at: http://www.globalplaza.org/\n\nVCC was developed in Ruby on Rails 2.3.4 and uses Isabel for web confereces. The most important differences included by Mconf-Web are the use of Rails 4 and the use of BigBlueButton as a replacement for Isabel. As time passes, more and more features and changes are made in Mconf-Web, making it today a completely different application from what VCC was initially."

						"content": "Basics\n\nLDAP is treated as a module in Mconf-Web. It can be easily disabled and enabled by an administrator. If enabled LDAP will always be used as the first authentication mechanism. If the login fails via LDAP, it falls back to the local authentication, so it is transparent to the user. If the user is signed in via LDAP, he can see a message telling him of that in his account page.\n\nInternally, Mconf-Web automatically creates a user account for the user in his first connection via LDAP. This account has a random password that should not be used to log in using the local authentication (even though it could be used).\n\nServer configuration\n\nIf you do not want to connect to LDAP using LDAPS (secure connection) you can skip this section and move to the “Website configuration” section.\n\nIf you choose to enable LDAPS you must follow these two steps, they are:\n\n\n  Step 1 - Configure the file /etc/ldap/ldap.conf\n    \n      In this file you should put the full path where you’re going to place the certificate for the ldap server;\n    \n  \n  Step 2 - Place the certificate for the LDAP server\n    \n      Now you must place the certificate on the specified path chosen on the latter step (step 1).\n    \n  \n\n\nFor now this is all that is necessary to be done to successfully connect to a LDAP server using LDAPS (port 636) to create a secure connection to the server.\n\nWebsite configuration\n\nTo be able to use authentication via LDAP you must set some variables that are going to define the correct usage of the LDAP server and its data. To set these variables, go to the management page (read more about it here). The variables are:\n\n\n  LDAP: Enable authentication: Check it to enable authentication via LDAP. If checked, LDAP will always be used as the first authentication mechanism. If the login fails via LDAP, it falls back to the local authentication.\n  LDAP: Server IP or domain: Insert the IP or domain of the LDAP server (e.g. ‘192.111.22.33’ or ‘ldapserver.any.com’).\n  LDAP: Server port: Insert the port which will be used to connect to the LDAP server (for LDAPS connection use 636).\n  LDAP: Full DN for the user: Insert the full DN (Distinguished Name) of the user to be used to connect to the LDAP server.\n  LDAP: User password: Insert the password for the user that is going to access the LDAP server.\n  LDAP: Full DN for UsersTreebase: This specifies the LDAP branch (DN) where the users that need to authenticate are located.\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the username: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the username of a user (e.g.: ‘uid’).\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user's email: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the email of a user (e.g.: ‘mail’).\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user's full name: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the full name of a user (e.g.: ‘cn’).\n\n\nOnce all options are set, the authentication via LDAP will be enabled. Every time a user tries to log in, the application will first try to authenticate him against the LDAP server. If it fails for some reason, it falls back to the local authentication.\n\nIf you have problems, check your log for messages starting with LDAP:. They are added by the authentication class, that can be found here."

It assumes you already have an instance of Mconf-Web working in production mode.\n\nCertificate\n\nThe first thing you need is a SSL certificate. There is plenty of information about it in the Internet (just search for “SSL certificate”), but the fastest way to get things going is to create a self-signed certificate. See below how to do it (with instructions taken from this page – in Portuguese).\n\nCopy the following content to a file named /tmp/openssl.conf, replacing all comments between &lt; and &gt; by the appropriate values.\n\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 2048 # Size of keys\nstring_mask = nombstr # permitted characters\ndistinguished_name = req_distinguished_name\n\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\n# Variable name   Prompt string\n#----------------------   ----------------------------------\n0.organizationName = &lt;Name of your organization&gt;\norganizationalUnitName = &lt;Department in your organization&gt;\norganizationalUnitName_default = &lt;Same as above&gt;\nemailAddress = &lt;Email address&gt;\nemailAddress_max = 40\nlocalityName = &lt;City name&gt;\nstateOrProvinceName = &lt;State name&gt;\ncountryName = &lt;Country name (2 letters)&gt;\ncountryName_default = &lt;Same as above&gt;\ncountryName_min = 2\ncountryName_max = 2\ncommonName = &lt;Host name including the domain&gt;\ncommonName_default = &lt;Same as above&gt;\ncommonName_max = 64\n\n\n\nGenerate the key with the commands below (replace $HOSTNAME by the name of your host, e.g. myserver.com):\n\n$ sudo openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.key 2048 -config /tmp/openssl.conf\n$ sudo openssl req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.key -out /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.csr -batch -config /tmp/openssl.conf\n$ sudo openssl x509 -req -days 730 -in /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.csr -signkey /etc/ssl/private/$HOSTNAME.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/$HOSTNAME.crt\n\n\n\nYour self-signed certificate will be at: /etc/ssl/certs/$HOSTNAME.crt.\n\nAnd now you can remove the /tmp/openssl.conf file:\n\n$ rm /tmp/openssl.conf\n\n\n\nConfiguring Apache\n\nAt first, enable some modules that will be needed:\n\n$ sudo a2enmod ssl\n$ sudo a2enmod rewrite\n\n\n\nThere will be a configuration file to listen to requests on port 80 and rewrite them all to port 443. If you already have Mconf-Web running, you will already have a configuration file that should be at /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/mconf-web. Edit this file to include the contents of: https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/v2.0.x/config/webserver/apache2_ssl_80.example (replace YOUR_HOST by your server’s name or IP).\n\nYou can also download the new file and replace the old one – be careful! – with:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/webserver/apache2_ssl_80.example -O /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web.conf\n\n\n\nThen install the configuration file that will respond to requests on port 443:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/webserver/apache2_ssl_443.example -O /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web-ssl.conf\n\n\n\nIn this file (/etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web-ssl) you will have to edit all occurrences of YOUR_IP, YOUR_HOST, YOUR_CERT and /somewhere/public by the appropriate values.\n\nEnable the new configuration file:\n\n$ sudo a2ensite mconf-web-ssl\n\n\n\nRestart Apache:\n\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\nConfiguring the application\n\nAfter enabling SSL in your server, you have to configure Mconf-Web to use it. You can either access the management page (that might not be accessible now) or do it from your terminal with:\n\n$ cd /home/mconf/mconf-web/current\n./script/rails runner -e production \"Site.current.update_attributes(:ssl =&gt; true)\"\n\n\n\nThis will update the attribute that informs the application to use SSL. The application should already work even if this flag is not set, but still you need to set it so the application can generate correct links (i.e. using HTTPS instead of HTTP) when sending emails, for instance.\n\nFirewall\n\nHTTPS uses port 443, so make sure it is not blocked in your firewall.\n\nIf you’re using iptables, you can add the following lines to your /etc/default/firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS:\n\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport   80 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport  443 -j ACCEPT"

						"categories": "Mconf-Web",
						"url": " /mconf-web/mconf-web-shibboleth/",
						"content": "Introduction\n\nShibboleth is a solution that allows federated “single sign-in”. In brief, this is how it works:\n\n  Users access services provided by “service providers” (e.g. a web application like Mconf-Web), but their authentication is made through an entity called “identity provider”.\n  The service provider redirects the users to the identity provider, the user enters his credentials, the identity provider validates the credentials and redirects the user back to the service provider.\n  The service provider receives just a controlled set of information of the user, such as his name and email. This means that the user will trust his credentials to the identity provider only, and not to the service providers.\n\n\nYou can read more about it here and here.\n\nA brief description of how it works on Mconf-Web\n\nMost of the implementation of Shibboleth on Mconf-Web is done by using the Shibboleth module for Apache (mod_shib2). Once the Shibboleth module is installed and configured, when a user is redirected to the url /secure in your Mconf-Web server, Apache will redirect the user to the identity provider configured. After the authentication is done in the service and identity providers, the user is redirected back to Mconf-Web.\n\nMconf-Web will have access only to the information the identity provider returns. With this information a new account will be created automatically for the user. This happens only in the first access: in subsequent accesses the user will just access his account that was already created. On the first access the user has also the option to associate his federated account with an account on Mconf-Web, in case the user already had an account created on Mconf-Web.\n\nInstall and configure Apache’s Shibboleth module\n\nThe configuration of a Shibboleth service provider is usually different for different federations. Some steps are shared in all installations, but some others are unique and depend on how the federation is configured. In this page we will show a guide with all the steps we use to configure Mconf-Web for the Brazilian federation CAFe, that was used while the integration with Shibboleth was implemented in Mconf-Web. You can use it as a guide, but we strongly recommend also getting help from the people responsible for the federation you want to integrate Mconf-Web with and review every step while executing this guide.\n\nThis guide is strongly based on: http://wiki.rnp.br/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41616305\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n  You need a server with Mconf-Web up and running. See this guide.\n  Your Mconf-Web server needs to be using HTTPS (SSL). See this guide.\n\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall Apache’s module for Shibboleth:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-shib2\n\n\n\nEnable it:\n\n$ sudo a2enmod shib2\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nYou need to configure your site in Apache to trigger the Shibboleth authentication when users access the path /secure. To do that, add the contents of the file config/webserver/apache2_shibboleth.example to the bottom of your /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web-ssl, just before the closing &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; tag.\n\nThen configure how the Shibboleth module will communicate with the identity provider. This step will probably be different for other federations, this is just and example of what has to be configured.\n\nDownload these files (if they already exist, you will be replacing them):\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/shibboleth/cafe/shibboleth2.xml -O /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/shibboleth/cafe/attribute-map.xml -O /etc/shibboleth/attribute-map.xml\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/shibboleth/cafe/attribute-policy.xml -O /etc/shibboleth/attribute-policy.xml\n\n\n\nOpen /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml and replace:\n\n\n  $DOMAIN by you server’s domain, e.g. server.institution.com.\n\n\nMetadata\n\nCreate a metadata file that will added in the metadata pool in your identity provider so that your application to be able to access it. The format of this file will probably be different for different federations.\n\nTo use our example metadata, first download it:\n\n$ sudo wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/v2.0.x/config/shibboleth/cafe/metadata-sp.xml -O /root/metadata-sp.xml\n\n\n\nThere are several things to be edited in this file. It should be very straightforward, you just have to edit everything that starts with a $. Some examples for the values that should be added to this metadata file:\n\n\n  $DOMAIN: server.my-institution.com;\n  $INSTITUTION: My Institution;\n  $INSTITUTION_DOMAIN: my-institution.com.\n  $SERVICE_NAME: My Web Conference Service.\n  $SERVICE_DESCRIPTION: The best web conference server around.\n  $ADMIN_NAME: John Doe.\n  $ADMIN_EMAIL: john@my-institution.com.\n\n\nYou can leave the $CERTIFICATE part as it is for now, we will fill it up soon.\n\nCertificate\n\nYou need a certificate to link to your Shibboleth installation. You can generate one with the command below. Replace $DOMAIN by your server’s domain (e.g. server.my-institution.com).\n\n$ sudo shib-keygen -y 3 -h $DOMAIN -e https://$DOMAIN/shibboleth\n\n\n\nThis command will create two files: /etc/shibboleth/sp-key.pem and /etc/shibboleth/sp-cert.pem. If you used the configuration files above, these certificates files will already be referenced in the section CredentialResolver of /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml. Otherwise, change it to be like the example below:\n\n&lt;CredentialResolver type=\"File\" key=\"sp-key.pem\"\n                    certificate=\"sp-cert.pem\" keyName=\"$DOMAIN\"/&gt;\n\n\n\nAt last, edit /root/metadata-sp.xml once again and replace the block with $CERTIFICATE by the contents of /etc/shibboleth/sp-cert.pem. Make sure you do not include the first and last lines, the ones with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----.\n\nEnable and configure Shibboleth inside Mconf-Web\n\nHaving your server configured, you now have to enable and configure Shibboleth inside Mconf-Web.\n\nGo to the management area and you will see some parameters used to configure Shibboleth. They are:\n\n\n  Enable Shibboleth: If checked it will enable the login via Shibboleth and add information in the interface for the user to select it.\n  Shibboleth environment variables: When the identity provider returns the user’s information to Mconf-Web, they will be stored in environment variables. You can define in this field the name of the variables that will be read and stored within the session. If left empty, all variables that start with shib- will be fetched.\n  Shibboleth field for email: The name of the field that will be used as the user’s email.\n  Shibboleth field for name: The name of the field that will be used as the user’s full name.\n  Shibboleth field for principal name (unique ID): The name of the field that will be used to get the “principal name” of the user. This should be a field that contains only unique values, since it will be used to identify the user. Several academic institutions use the “eduPerson-principalName” (EPPN) as the unique attribute, and this is why we call it “principal name” here. If you don’t use it, you could very well use the same field as the email field, as long as the emails are unique. Note that Mconf-Web cannot deal with changes in the “principal name” in the federation, since it is used as the identifier internally.\n  Shibboleth field for login: The name of the field that will be used as the user’s login. if not informed, the login will be generated from the user’s name. This field doesn’t have to contain “login-like” values; the value will be adapted to be a valid login by Mconf-Web (e.g. “My Name” is changed to “my-name”).\n  Shibboleth: always create new account: If this flag is set, when a user signs in via Shibboleth, Mconf-Web will automatically create an account for the user; there will be no option to associate the Shibboleth credentials with an existent account.\n  Shibboleth: update users: If this flag is set, some of the user information will be automatically updated on Mconf-Web right before the user signs in via Shibboleth. So if the user’s email changes in the federation, for example, it will be automatically updated on Mconf-Web. As of now, the attributes that are updated are the email and the full name. If this feature is on, users will not be able to edit these attributes via Mconf-Web (so the email and full name inputs will be disabled).\n\n\nYou can see in the picture below an example of how these fields can be configured:"

						"content": "Emails are not being sent\n\nMconf-Web 2.0\n\nTo start, try to understand how emails are sent in Mconf-Web.\n\nThe site table has several columns that store the information about your SMTP account. You can configure them in the management page. These configurations will be used to send all emails from within Mconf-Web.\n\nWhen an email needs to be sent, the application will store information internally (using redis) and an external process (Resque) will read the job and deliver the email. This process is monitored by another process called Monit, that is also responsible for starting and stopping it. To know how to use Monit, see this page.\n\nSo, unless you have Monit and Resque running on your servers, no emails will be delivered. You can check if they are running with:\n\n$ ps aux | grep -e resque -e monit\nroot      4341  0.0  0.0 108556  1348 ?        Sl   Jun01   3:52 /usr/bin/monit -c /etc/monit/monitrc\nmconf     5957  0.0  6.7 944300 138276 ?       Sl   Jun16   1:38 resque-1.25.2: Waiting for *\nmconf     6004  0.0  6.7 944112 138164 ?       Sl   Jun16   1:40 resque-1.25.2: Waiting for *\nmconf     6053  0.0  6.7 944276 138260 ?       Sl   Jun16   1:43 resque-1.25.2: Waiting for *\nmconf     9328  0.1  6.8 1473604 140672 ?      Sl   06:20   0:26 resque-scheduler-3.0.0[production]: Schedules Loaded\n\n\n\nIf they are not running, make sure everything is installed correctly and try to restart Monit and Resque, always following the guide to install.\n\nIf they are running, the next step is to check Resque monitoring interface. Open Mconf-Web in your browser and sign in as an administrator. Then access the URL /manage/resque.\nThis page will show you how many Resque workers are running and a list of queues with the jobs being processed and possibly a list of failed jobs. If there are failed jobs, open the “failed” queue and check the errors that are happening. This is usually the easiest way to find common errors such as wrong SMTP credentials.\n\nIf you still can’t figure out why emails are not being sent, check the logs generated by Resque and Monit, they might point you in the right direction. You can see where to find these logs in this page.\n\nMoreover, remember that whenever you change the SMTP information in your Mconf-Web, you have to restart all Resque processes, otherwise they will still be using the old configurations!\n\nMconf-Web 0.8.x\n\nTo start, try to understand how emails are sent in Mconf-Web.\n\nThe site table has several columns that store the information about your SMTP account. You can configure them in the management page. This email will be used to send all emails from within Mconf-Web. Currently only you can use an SMTP account, including Gmail accounts.\n\nWhen an email needs to be sent, a “job” is stored in the database and an external process (a gem called delayed_job) will read the job and deliver the email. This process is monitored by another gem called god, that is also responsible for starting and stopping it. So you don’t ever need to deal with delayed_job directly, only with god.\n\nTo know how to use god, see this page. Once you have it installed, you can try to stop it, restart and check the log in case of errors:\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god terminate\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/god start\n\n\n\nThis is the default log file for god. It is created when god is executed by the script /etc/init.d/god:\n\n$ tail -100 /var/log/god.log\n\n\n\nAlso, sometimes god might start but delayed_job won’t. You can see the delayed_job log files at:\n\n~/mconf-web/current/log/god_delayed_job.0.log\n~/mconf-web/current/log/god_delayed_job.1.log\n\n\n\nThe directories where these files are located are defined in delayed_job’s config file. You can see this file on our GitHub page and in your machine it should be at:\n\n/etc/god/conf.d/delayed_job.god\n\n\n\nCheck if the file it is correct.\n\nThe way this script starts delayed_job is with a command like this:\n\n$ cd /home/mconf/mconf-web/current; /usr/bin/env RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec script/delayed_job --pid-dir=/home/mconf/mconf-web/current/tmp/pids -i 0 start\n\n\n\nYou can try to run this command to see what happens, it should otuput the error (if any) in the console. This is executed with the user mconf.\n\nIf it doesn’t work, there is an even simpler version of it:\n\n$ cd /home/mconf/mconf-web/current\n$ /usr/bin/env RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec script/delayed_job start\n\n\n\nAlso, make sure that your application’s .rvmrc file is trusted (more details here), otherwise delayed_job might not start:\n\n$ rvm rvmrc trust ~/mconf-web/current/.rvmrc\n\n\n\nIf you’re in a development environment, you don’t need god. Just run delayed_job with:\n\n$ bundle exec script/delayed_job -n 2 start\n\n\n\nIf you’re familiar with Rails and the Rails console, you can use a few more advanced commands to deal with emails. Open your Rails console (RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails s) and:\n\n# find how many jobs are in the queue\nDelayed::Job.find(:all).count\n# retry a single job\nDelayed::Job.find(:all)[0].payload_object.perform\n# for all jobs\nDelayed::Job.find(:all).each { |j|\n  begin\n    j.payload_object.perform\n  rescue Exception =&gt; e\n    puts e.inspect\n  end\n}\n# remove a job\nDelayed::Job.find(:all)[0].destroy\n\n\n\nWrong username and/or password for MySQL\n\nThe following box shows an example of an error that occurs when your Mysql2 user and/or password are wrong and you’re trying to setup Mconf-Web. The following error has happened trying to setup a production environment using the wrong database password for the user “root”.\n\nCouldn't drop mconf_production : #&lt;Mysql2::Error: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)&gt;\n* Running the task: db:create\nAccess denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES).\nPlease provide the root password for your mysql installation\n\n\nThe database username and password are configured in the file config/database.yml.\n\nIf you haven’t set up a password for MySQL yet, you can do it with:\n\nmysqladmin -u root password \"NEW-PASSWORD\"\n\n\nOr, in case you want to change the password:\n\nmysqladmin -u root -p password \"NEW-PASSWORD\"\n\n\n\nOpenSSL::SSL::SSLError\n\nIf you see an error similar to the one below in your application’s log file, you are probably accessing the application using HTTP but SSL is enabled in your site (or the opposite).\n\nOpenSSL::SSL::SSLError (SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv2/v3 read server hello A: unknown protocol)\n\n\n\nTo fix it, go to your application’s directory and open the rails console:\n\ncd /var/www/mconf-web/current\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c\n\n\n\nAnd then run:\n\nSite.current.update_attributes(:ssl =&gt; false)\n\n\n\nIf you’re seeing this error in a background job (e.g. when trying to send an email), the flag you should set to false is smtp_use_tls:\n\nSite.current.update_attributes(:smtp_use_tls =&gt; false)\n\n\n\nThen remember to restart your application and all background jobs to make sure the change is applied."

						"content": "Overview\n\nThis is a step-by-step guide showing every detail needed to install Mconf-Web. If you have experience deploying a Rails application this guide should look very familiar to you.\n\nMconf-Web is developed in and targeted to Ubuntu systems. We recommend the use of an specific version of Ubuntu (see below).\n\nThe recommended setup for the latest version of Mconf-Web is:\n\n\n  Ubuntu 14.04 operating system with a user named mconf (do not use root).\n  Ruby is installed with rbenv.\n  Phusion Passenger (ruby app server).\n  Apache 2.4.\n  MySQL database.\n\n\nThis guide guide will instruct you on how to set up this environment.\n\nMconf-Web can also be adapted to your needs. It is a Ruby on Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application. It should work on any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do). But be aware that changing any of these components will probably require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes). Some things, such as trying out a new version of Ubuntu, shouldn’t be troublesome. Be careful if you’re doing it, the instructions here were not tested in other environments than the one described above.\n\nMigrate from 0.8.x\n\nIf you are migrating to Mconf-Web 2.x, check these pages for more information:\n\n\n  Migrate from 0.8.1 to 2.0 by installing a new server (recommended)\n  Migrate from 0.8.1 to 2.0 by upgrading your server\n\n\nInstalling Mconf-Web\n\nSystem Packages\n\nYou need to install some system packages before you can run Mconf-web in production:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install curl make git-core libruby aspell-es aspell-en \\\n    libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev \\\n    imagemagick libmysqlclient-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential nfs-common \\\n    libreadline-dev libffi-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev mysql-server \\\n    redis-server openjdk-7-jre apache2 libapache2-mod-xsendfile\n\n\n\nThis will install several libraries and a few applications and tools Mconf-Web needs.\n\nYou will be prompted to type a password for MySQL’s root user in case you don’t have MySQL server installed yet. You can choose any password you want. The root user will not be used by Mconf-Web, it will only be used by you to configure MySQL.\n\nRuby\n\nMconf-web uses Ruby 2.2.5. To install Ruby, we suggest the use of rbenv.\n\nBut you have other options:\n\n\n  Using RVM: see this page.\n  Using apt packages.\n  From source.\n\n\nFrom now on, we will assume you will use rbenv, so if you decide for another method you might have to adapt some of commands in the rest of this guide.\n\nThe commands below will show you how to install rbenv. In short, this is what you will be doing:\n\n\n  Install rbenv\n  Install the plugin ruby-build plugin, that will actually be used to install ruby\n  Install the target ruby\n  Install bundler\n\n\nImportant: if you have RVM installed, you should remove it first!\n\n# Install rbenv\ngit clone git://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\necho 'eval \"$(rbenv init -)\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n# install ruby build\ngit clone git://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build\n\n# install ruby\nrbenv install 2.2.5\nrbenv rehash\n\n# set this version of ruby as the default and check it is correct\nrbenv global 2.2.5\nrbenv version\n&gt; 2.2.5 (set by /home/mconf/.rbenv/version)\n\n# install bundler\ngem install bundler -v '1.7.2'\nrbenv rehash\n\n\n\nDownload the application\n\nWe’ll assume the application is going to be installed at /var/www/mconf-web/current. You can change this, but be aware that you might have to adapt several configuration files during the rest of the installation. We’ll also assume your user is named mconf.\n\nInstall git if you don’t have it and clone Mconf-Web:\n\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/mconf-web/current\nsudo chown mconf:www-data /var/www/mconf-web/current # www-data is for Apache\ngit clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git /var/www/mconf-web/current\n\n\n\nNext, change your repository to the version you want to deploy (replace v2.4.0 by the desired version):\n\ncd /var/www/mconf-web/current\ngit checkout v2.4.0\n\n\n\nThe versions available are the tags available. To see all versions, go to this page.\n\nWith the repository you can now install the dependencies. Run the commands below:\n\nbundle install --path vendor/bundle --without=development test\n\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\nThere are two files that need to be configured and they are both required. At first, copy the example files:\n\ncp /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/setup_conf.yml.example /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/setup_conf.yml\ncp /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/database.yml.example /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/database.yml\n\n\n\nSee below what you have to edit in setup_conf.yml and database.yml:\n\n\n  \n    database.yml configures the database, using MySQL by default. You only need to set the variables username and password (for all environments) with the user that will be used to access MySQL and his password. We recommend a user other than root (usually mconf). See in the section 4.1. below how to create this user.\n  \n  \n    setup_conf.yml has general configurations for the web application, some are required when the application is started and some are only used once when creating the database. For the latter, you can also later use Mconf-Web’s management interface (see this page) to edit them. If you don’t edit this file, the default administrator account will have username admin and password admin.\n  \n\n\nWe suggest that you restrict the permissions to these files, since they will contain sensitive information:\n\nsudo chmod 0600 /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/setup_conf.yml\nsudo chmod 0600 /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/database.yml\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the other options in these files, see this page).\n\nDatabase user\n\nThis section explains how to create a database for Mconf-Web with a user named mconf and give him access to it.\n\nFirst open MySQL’s console (you will have to enter the password for the root user):\n\nmysql -u root -p\n\n\n\n(If you’re having trouble with the root password in MySQL, see this FAQ entry.)\n\nTo create the database run:\n\nCREATE DATABASE mconf_production;\n\n\n\nThen create the user (change all occurrences of password below by the actual password):\n\nCREATE USER \"mconf\"@\"localhost\" IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_production.* TO \"mconf\"@\"localhost\";\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n\nApplication configurations\n\nWith the configuration files properly set, we’ll now set up the database and generate a new secret key for the application:\n\ncd /var/www/mconf-web/current\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:reset\n\n# This command will change the secret keys used by the application for cookies and\n# passwords. It's really important that you do it, otherwise your application will\n# use the default values (that are public!) and will be vulnerable.\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake secret:reset\n\n\n\nThen precompile the assets (this might take a few minutes to finish):\n\nbundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets assets:precompile\n\n\n\nWeb server\n\nThe web server we use to host Mconf-Web is Apache. We also use Passenger to server the application together with Apache. So you’ll have to install Passenger and use it in the configurations of Apache.\n\nPassenger with Apache 2.4\n\nInstall Passenger (it’s a ruby gem) and its module for Apache. Passenger has a nice installer that will compile the Apache module and install it for you. If some dependency is missing it will warn you and help you install it. Run the following commands:\n\ngem install rack:1.5.5 passenger:4.0.59\nrbenv rehash\npassenger-install-apache2-module\n\n\n(Note: we install rack also because newer versions of it require ruby &gt; 2.2.0.)\n\nThe application passenger-install-apache2-module is interactive and has the following steps:\n\n\n  Check for dependencies: If your system is missing any required software, it will warn you and tell you how to install them. You have to install all packages suggested! Simply exit the passenger installer, install the packages and then run the passenger installer again;\n  Ask you which languages you’re interested in using Passenger with. You can leave only ruby checked.\n  Automatically compile and install the module for Apache;\n  It will show you some lines that must be added the you Apache configuration file. Ignore this for now, the next step of this guide will show you how to configure it.\n  In the last step it will give you an example of how to deploy an application. Ignore the example for now, the next step of this guide will show you the specific configurations for Mconf-web.\n\n\nOnce Passenger has finished installing, enable its module in Apache with:\n\npassenger-install-apache2-module --snippet | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/mconf-passenger.conf\nsudo a2enconf mconf-passenger\n\n\n\nThis will create a new configuration file with the Passenger module snippet, the same block Passenger showed you in the last item after the installation.\n\nSee more about Passenger at their website and read this guide to see more about how it can be used with Apache.\n\nApache configurations\n\nBy default Apache is installed at /etc/apache2/ and it’s configuration file will be at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.\nYou can add configuration files at /etc/apache2/conf-available/ and sites at /etc/apache2/sites-available/.\n\nAt first we enable some modules in Apache and remove any default site (in case it exists):\n\nsudo a2enmod rewrite\nsudo a2enmod xsendfile\nsudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*  # be careful if you have something installed already!\n\n\n\nNow you need to add a configuration file for Mconf-Web. You might just download our example and edit it:\n\nsudo cp /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/webserver/apache2.example /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web.conf\n\n\n\nThe file will be saved at /etc/apache2/sites-available/mconf-web.conf.\n\nYou should change YOUR_HOST by your IP or domain and /YOUR_MCONF_WEB/public (both occurrences) to the path to your Mconf-Web application, that should be /var/www/mconf-web/current/public (don’t forget to point to the public directory!).\n\nReview also the LimitRequestBody option, that is used to limit the size of files uploaded to Mconf-Web and defaults to 15 MB. You can change it to whatever you want, just remember to also change the option available in the [[management configuration of your site|Configuring the Website]] to the same value you configure on Apache. Notice that Apache uses 2014 as the multiplier for file sizes. This means that, if you set “15 MB” as the maximum file size in Mconf-Web, for example, you need to set “15728640” in Apache. These are some other examples of matching values in Mconf-Web and in Apache:\n\n  5 MB = 5242880\n  10 MB = 10485760\n  50 MB = 52428800\n\n\nAfter editing the file, enable it in Apache with:\n\nsudo a2ensite mconf-web\n\n\n\nAt last, restart Apache and it should be ready to serve Mconf-Web:\n\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\nAt this point you should already be able to access your application in your browser!\n\nMonit\n\nMonit is a tool for managing and monitoring processes in UNIX systems. It is installed as packages in your server and configured to monitor some processes needed by Mconf-Web. Monit will make sure all processes related to Mconf-Web are running, and it’s your job to make sure that Monit is always running.\n\nInstall monit:\n\nsudo apt-get install monit\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t have problems regarding the version of Monit being used, but, for a reference, these instructions have been tested with Monit 5.3.2.\n\nThe configuration files Mconf-Web uses for Monit are found in the application’s folder config/monit/. We will simply include these files in Monit’s configuration file, so they are loaded when monit starts. First, open the configuration file with an editor:\n\nsudo vim /etc/monit/monitrc\n\n\n\nChange the monitoring interval to 1 minute (it usually defaults to 2 minutes):\n\nset daemon 60\n\n\n\nEnable HTTP support by uncommenting the following lines:\n\nset httpd port 2812 and\n   use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost\n   allow localhost\n\n\n\nThen install the configuration file:\n\nsudo cp /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/monit/resque_workers.monitrc /etc/monit/conf.d/resque_workers.monitrc\n\n\n\nNotice that this file contains the path to the application and the user/group that should be used to run the processes. They are set to use the default folder (/var/www/mconf-web/current) and user/group (mconf:mconf), but you should always check them to see if they fit your environment!\n\nManaging Monit: start, stop, log files\n\nTo start and stop Monit you can simply run:\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/monit stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/monit start\n\n\n\nBe aware that stopping Monit will not stop the processes it monitors. You have to stop them individually before or after stopping Monit. When you start Monit, however, all processes are started. Monit is also started automatically when your server is started, so all processes will automatically be started.\n\nYou can check if the processes being monitored are running with:\n\nps aux | grep -e resque\n\n\n\nThe response you get should include the processes in the example output below:\n\nmconf  13082  0.0 10.5 944220 106708 ?  Sl  Nov08  1:06 resque-1.25.1: Waiting for all\n\n\n\nTo start or stop the processes individually, use:\n\n# for resque workers: all of them\nsudo monit -g resque_workers start\nsudo monit -g resque_workers stop\n\n# for all services\nsudo monit start all\nsudo monit stop all\n\n\n\nIf any of the commands above fail with the message monit: Cannot connect to the monit daemon. Did you start it with http support?, you need to enable http support on Monit’s config file. Open the configuration file at /etc/monit/monitrc. Search for a section similar to the one below and uncomment it:\n\nset httpd port 2812 and\n   use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost\n   allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and\n\n\n\nLog files\n\nMonit’s log file is located at /var/log/monit.log. The log files for the processes it monitors are at:\n\n/var/www/mconf-web/current/log/resque_workers_all.log\n/var/www/mconf-web/current/log/resque_scheduler.log\n\n\n\nLogrotate\n\nLogrotate is a utility that prevents logs from getting too big by creating new files and compacting the old ones.\n\nYou server should already have it installed, but if it doesn’t, install it with:\n\nsudo apt-get install logrotate\n\n\n\nThe configuration file for logrotate can be copied from Mconf-Web’s repository with:\n\nsudo cp /var/www/mconf-web/current/config/logrotate/mconf-web /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n\n\n\nIf you have Mconf-Web installed in a path other than /var/www/mconf-web/current, you will have to edit the  application path in the configuration file above.\n\nThen set the permissions and activate logrotate:\n\nsudo chown root:root /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\nsudo logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/status /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web\n\n\n\nIf the last command doesn’t print any errors, it should be working. Check the log folder inside your Mconf-Web to see if the log files have been changed.\n\nDone!\n\nAt this point you finished installing Mconf-Web. The first thing you might want to do is access the application and configure it).\n\nMaintenance tasks\n\nRestart\n\nTo restart the application you need to restart the web server and all processes being monitored:\n\nsudo service apache2 restart\nsudo /etc/init.d/monit restart\nsudo monit restart all\n\n\n\nThe web server you’ll need to restart every time you change anything in the application (source code) or configuration files. You don’t always need to restart Monit, only if you changed anything in its configuration files or in files that the monitored processes use (for example, if you change the Gmail account settings used to send emails). If you’re not sure, restart it.\n\nBackup\n\nThe most important backup you need is your database. If you’re using MySQL, you can use the following commands to backup (and restore) the database used by Mconf-Web:\n\n# backup: dump the database to a .sql file\nmysqldump -u root -p mconf_production &gt; mconf_production-`date +%F`.sql\n\n# restore: load the .sql file\nmysql -u root -p mconf_production &lt; mconf_production-2011-06-21.sql\n\n\n\nThere are also files that are not stored in the database, such as user avatars and attachments. And you also might want to backup your log files. So make sure you back up the files in the following folders:\n\n/var/www/mconf-web/current/private/uploads/\n/var/www/mconf-web/current/public/uploads/\n/var/www/mconf-web/current/log/\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nImportant: These instructions are only valid if you are updating your version from Mconf-Web 2.0 to newer 2.x versions. If you are upgrading from previous versions of Mconf-Web to 2.x, check the section Migrate from 0.8.x.\n\nAt first, update your repository and get the version you want (replace v2.4.0 by the desired version):\n\ncd /var/www/mconf-web/current\ngit pull\ngit checkout v2.4.0\n\n\n\nUpdate the dependencies:\n\nbundle install --without=development test\n\n\n\nMigrate the database:\n\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate\n\n\n\nRecompile the assets:\n\nbundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets assets:precompile\n\n\n\nThere are also other files that might need to be updated, such as the configuration files for Monit, that will not be configured with the commands above. To check if you need to do any extra work, look at the update notes in the changelog.\n\nRestart the web server as described previously."

						"content": "About\n\nMconf-Web stores all its configurations in a database and provides a management interface in the website where an admin user can edit most of these configurations. All important site-wide configurations are available in this management page. If you can’t find an option you need, feel free to require a change posting an issue in our issue tracker.\n\nThere are basically 3 ways to configure the website:\n\n\n  Using the management area in the website: this is what you should do, see more about it below;\n  Pre-populate the database before creating it, using setup_conf.yml file: useful for development or to setup more than one website (see more about it at the end of this page);\n  Hacking the source code and directly editing the database: you’ll only need to do it if you need to change something that is not yet configurable using the management page. You’ll also need knowledge in Rails and the internals of Mconf-Web.\n\n\nIt is also important to point out that the majority of the things you change in the configurations of Mconf-Web will require a restart in the application.\n\nManagement area\n\nWhen you first setup Mconf-Web, an administrator user will be created. The default username, email and password are defined in the setup_conf.yml. By default these configurations are:\n\n\n  email: admin@default.com\n  login: admin\n  password: admin\n\n\nLog in with this user and you will have access to the management area using a link in the top bar:\n\n\n\nClicking on this link will take you to the page with the website’s configurations. It will look similar to the image below:\n\n\n\nClicking in the “Edit” button at the bottom of the page will take you to the page to edit these configurations. When viewing or editing the configurations, use the help icons to get more information about each option:\n\n\n\nSome of the most important things to edit are the username and the password of the email account that will be used to send all emails generated in Mconf-Web (registration confirmations, password resets, web conference invitations, and others). You can configure any SMTP account (by default we use a Gmail account). Changing any property related to this require you to restart the server to take effect.\n\nThe attributes currently available to be configured in this page are:\n\n\n  Name: The name of your website.\n  Description: A description for your website.\n  Application Domain: The domain of your server (e.g. my-server.com).\n  Language: Default language for your website (e.g. en).\n  Visible languages: Check the languages you wish to use in the website.\n  Timezone: Default timezone for the website. Will be used for all users that have not set their timezone.\n  Signature: Signature used in emails sent from your website.\n  SSL: Mark if you need to use SSL/HTTPS in your website. This is necessary so the application can generate links with HTTPS instead of HTTP when necessary (e.g. in emails that have links to the application).\n  Feedback URL: URL that will be opened after a user logs out of a conference (e.g. a Google Drive doc such as https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1&amp;formkey=123456789123456789#gid=0).\n  Automatically set the recording flag when creating a web conference: If checked, the recording flag will be set according to the recording permission of the user that is creating the conference. If unchecked, users that have permission to record will see a popup to choose to record or not when creating a conference.\n  Analytics Code: Code for Google Analytics (e.g. UA-12345678-9).\n  Shibboleth: Enable: Mark if you want to allow shibboleth login in your website.\n  Shibboleth environment variables: Shibboleth variables that the application will read from the environment (e.g. shib-.*).\n  Shibboleth field for email: Shibboleth variable that will be used as the user’s email (e.g. Shib-inetOrgPerson-mail).\n  Shibboleth field for name: Shibboleth variable that will be used as the user’s name (e.g. Shib-inetOrgPerson-sn).\n  Shibboleth field for principal name: Shibboleth variable that will be used to get the user’s identifier in the federation. Some federations use the email as the identifier, so you could set here the same attribute used for the email (e.g. Shib-inetOrgPerson-mail). Is used to identify the user on sign in.\n  Shibboleth field for login: Shibboleth variable that will be used as the user’s login (e.g. Shib-inetOrgPerson-id).\n  LDAP: Enable authentication: Mark if you want to allow login via LDAP in your website.\n  LDAP: Server IP or domain: Insert the IP or domain of the LDAP server (e.g. ‘192.111.22.33’ or ‘ldapserver.any.com’).\n  LDAP: Server port: Insert the port which will be used to connect to the LDAP server (for LDAPS connection use 636).\n  LDAP: Full DN for the user: Insert the full DN (Distinguished Name) of the user to be used to connect to the LDAP server.\n  LDAP: User password: Insert the password for the user that is going to access the LDAP server.\n  LDAP: Full DN for UsersTreebase: This specifies the LDAP branch (DN) where the users that need to authenticate are located.\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the username: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the username of a user (e.g.: ‘uid’).\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user's email: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the email of a user (e.g.: ‘mail’).\n  LDAP: Field to obtain the user's full name: Specifies which attribute returned by LDAP will be used to obtain the full name of a user (e.g.: ‘cn’).\n  SMTP login: Login in your SMTP server (e.g. my-email@gmail.com).\n  SMTP password: Your SMTP password.\n  SMTP sender: Email used to send the emails (e.g. my-email-sender@gmail.com).\n  SMTP domain: The domain of your SMTP server (e.g. gmail.com).\n  SMTP server: Your SMTP server (e.g. smtp.gmail.com).\n  SMTP port: Port used for SMTP (e.g. 587).\n  Use TLS in SMTP: Mark if your need to use TLS in SMTP.\n  Auto start TLS in SMTP:  When set to true, detects if STARTTLS is enabled in your SMTP server and starts to use it.\n  SMTP authentication type: Authentication type for SMTP (e.g. login).\n  Send exception notifications: Mark if you want to receive emails when an exception occurs in your server.\n  Exception notifications recipients: List of emails that should receive debug messages.\n  Exception notifications subject prefix: Prefix used in the subject in debug messages (e.g. [mconf-web error]).\n  External help/FAQ page: Address of any web page that will be linked in the “Help” link at the footer. Can be an external web site and has to include the entire URL with the protocol (e.g. http://mywebsite.com/mconf-web-help).\n  Room dial number pattern: A pattern that is used to help admins generate dial numbers for rooms. If set, when an admins clicks in the button to generate a dial number for a room, it will use this pattern. In the pattern, xs are replaced by random numbers (e.g. 732-7xx-xxxx).\n  Allow users to create new accounts: When checked, users are able to register in the website. Otherwise all the registering features will be disabled. Useful to disable user registration if other authentication mechanism is in place (e.g. Shibboleth).\n  Moderate users: When checked, users will be able to register new accounts, but they will only be allowed to access the site once an administrator approves his account. Otherwise the users can freely access the website after registration. Be aware that if there are pending approvals and you uncheck this flag, these users will not be automatically approved!\n  Enable local authentication: When checked, users are able to sign in using the local authentication. Useful to disable local sign in if other authentication mechanism is in place (e.g. Shibboleth).\n  Moderate spaces: When checked, all spaces created by users will be unapproved and therefore inaccessible until an administrator approves it. Spaces not yet approved are only visible to the person that created it and have its features very limited. In short, the creator of the space can only view its basic information and change its name and description. Spaces created by administrators are automatically approved.\n  Forbid users from creating spaces: If checked, users will not be able to create spaces. Only admins will be able to.\n  Enable event module: Check it to enable the (still unfinished) even module.\n  Maximum size for uploads: Set a value to restrict the size of files uploaded to Mconf-Web. Includes all files uploaded by users: avatars, space logos and documents in spaces. Notice that this is a “soft limit”, imposed only via Javascript. To have a stronger restriction, set this value also on your Apache configurations, see [[Deployment Install Passenger]].\n\n\nWeb conference configurations\n\nAside from site-wide configurations, the management area tab shows link to manage spaces, users, and your web conferences servers and rooms. The web conference page will look similar to:\n\n\n\nIn this page you can alter your web conference server’s information, manage its rooms and also see the current activity in the server. Note: currently only one web conference server can be used. Even if you add more servers, all rooms will be created in the first one.\n\nClicking to edit the web conference server, will are able to alter the following properties:\n\n\n  Name: A name to identify the server internally;\n  URL: The URL to the API of the server, in the format http://server.com/bigbluebutton/api;\n  Security salt: The shared secret of this server;\n  Version: The version of the API of the web conference server (0.8, 0.9, etc). This attribute will be fetched automatically from your server once you save its information. You are not able to edit this attribute.\n  String ID: A string to identify the server internally and use in URLs.\n\n\nUser permissions\n\nAnother important feature is to be able to edit permissions for users. To do that, go to the user management page, find the target user and click in the “edit” icon near his/her name:\n\n\n\nYou will see a page where you can edit the information about the user and, in the bottom, you can check a few flags, including giving the user permission to record or making the user a global administrator (he/she will have full control of the website!):\n\n\n\nConfiguration files\n\nConfiguring the database (database.yml)\n\nThe database is configured in the file config/database.yml. This is a standard configuration file used by Rails applications, so you can find plenty of resources about it on the Internet (for example, this page).\n\nYou can also take a look at the examples in our repository:\n\n\n  Default example: Uses MySQL for all environments (recommended);\n  SQLite3 example: Example on how to use SQLite3.\n\n\nConfiguring the application (setup_conf.yml)\n\nThis file contains two sections, one with configurations that are loaded at every application startup and other that is used only once when the database is created.\n\nRemember to keep the file indented and formatted as it is. Its format and structure have semantic meaning, so you shouldn’t change them. Some of the parameters in this file are mandatory for the application to behave properly, so the application needs to be able to read it at startup.\n\nRead the comments in the example file (config/setup_conf.yml.example). If you don’t understand what some of the attributes are used for, don’t set them. Setting only the attributes defined in the example file is enough, you can then edit the rest of the configurations in the website interface."

						"content": "About\n\nThe Load Balancer (LB) implements BigBlueButton’s standard API, so that any application that integrates with Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton can also be used with the Load Balancer. This includes Mconf-Web and the integrations listed in BigBlueButton’s website.\n\nHowever, the LB’s API currently has some small differences from BigBlueButton’s API and more could be added in the future. But it is extremely important that, even with these small differences, the existent 3rd-party applications should not need to be adapted to use the Mconf infrastructure.\n\nThis API is built on top of the API of the latest Mconf-Live, that is based on BigBlueButton 0.81. Therefore, it supports everything from this version of Mconf-Live, with the differences described below and with a few restrictions described in the end of this page. To see everything that is supported by this API, read also these links:\n\n\n  Latest version of Mconf-Live: https://github.com/mconf/wiki/wiki/Mconf-Live-API-Changes\n  Base version of BigBlueButton in use: http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/081API\n\n\nThe differences between the API of the LB and the API of Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton are described below, as well as are the new API calls that were added to the LB.\n\nRoot path\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/\n\nWhat changed\n\nAccessing the root path of the API will return information about the server. In the Load Balancer some information was added to the response to include details about itself.\n\nResponse\n\n\n  \n    \n      Change\n      Param Name\n      When Returned\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Added\n      custom\n      Always\n      Block\n      Only a tag to group other tags.\n    \n    \n      Added\n      name\n      Always\n      String\n      Name of the application.\n    \n    \n      Added\n      version\n      Always\n      String\n      Current version of the application.\n    \n    \n      Added\n      deploy\n      Always\n      Number\n      Current deploy number (incremental since the first deploy).\n    \n    \n      Added\n      revision\n      Always\n      String\n      Current git revision.\n    \n  \n\n\nExample response\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n   &lt;returncode&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/returncode&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;0.8&lt;/version&gt;\n   &lt;custom&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;mconf-lb&lt;/name&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;0.3.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n      &lt;deploy&gt;16&lt;/deploy&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n      &lt;revision&gt;66c201586e9eecf233108cfb69ff771de3b21d6a&lt;/revision&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n   &lt;/custom&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nCreate\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/create\n\nWhat changed\n\nSome metadata keys are used internally by the Load Balancer, so they cannot be used by the integrations. If a create call has one of the reserved metadata keys, the Load Balancer will respond with an error.\n\nRestricted keys\n\n\n  \n    \n      Key\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      mconflb-guid\n      A globally unique identifier used to identify the load balancer\n    \n    \n      mconflb-institution\n      The institution (id) that created the meeting\n    \n    \n      mconflb-institution-name\n      The institution (name) that created the meeting\n    \n    \n      mconflb-rec-server\n      The recording server (id) where the recording will be stored\n    \n    \n      mconflb-rec-server-url\n      The recording server (url) where the recording will be stored\n    \n    \n      mconflb-rec-server-key\n      The recording server (public key) where the recording will be stored\n    \n  \n\n\nExample response\n\nThis response will be returned if any of the metadata keys in the table above are used in a create call. This is a failure response, so the create call will not be completed (i.e. the meeting will not be created).\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n   &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n   &lt;messageKey&gt;invalidParameters&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n   &lt;message&gt;The URL you supplied has parameters that are not accepted.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nCreate via POST\n\nWorks in the same way it is done in BigBlueButton’s API (read this link for more details) and is used to pre-upload slides when a meeting is created.\n\nTo test it you can use the command line tool curl. First save the following content in a file named post_data.xml:\n\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt; \n&lt;modules&gt; \n    &lt;module name=\"presentation\"&gt; \n        &lt;document url=\"http://www.samplepdf.com/sample.pdf\" /&gt; \n    &lt;/module&gt; \n&lt;/modules&gt; \n\n\nThen generate a link to a create call and run:\n\ncurl -i -X POST --data-binary @post_data.xml '&lt;your create call link&gt;' --header \"Content-Type:application/xml\" \n\n\nThen, when you join the target web conference you should see this pdf as the startup presentation.\n\nYou can also test it using the API Mate.\n\nIndicating a preferred server\n\nUsing preferredServer=&lt;server&gt; as an extra parameter in a create call, the caller is able to select a server in which the web conference will be created in spite of the load balancing algorithm. If the entered server is invalid, does not correspond to a server in the load balancer, or corresponds to a server that is disabled, this parameter will be ignored and a server will be selected using the standard load balancing algorithm. Only a single server can be passed at a time.\n\nThe identifier for a server is the server’s IP or domain name. In the Mconf Network, these identifiers are the names shown in the dashboard (e.g. rnp-bsb.mconf.org and mconf1.ufrgs.br). To get the list of servers available programmatically, use the API call getServers\n\nExample call:\n\nhttp://yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/create?name=abc&amp;meetingID=abc&amp;record=false&amp;preferredServer=143.10.10.198&amp;checksum=345bc221f9e332702d77fdbac3862636c8aba239\n\n\n\nPassing a voice bridge\n\nVoice bridges are the internal numbers used by the web conference server to identify the channel used to share voice in a meeting. A voice bridge can be passed to the create call using the parameter voiceBridge.\n\nRecommended values for voice bridges are five-digits numbers starting with 7 (i.e. [70000..79999]).\n\nThere’s a particularity of the load balancer in dealing with voice bridges: it will not allow duplicated voice bridges in a single server. So if you pass a voice bridge in the create call and this voice bridge is already being used in the server that was selected to hold your meeting, the load balancer will automatically generate a unique voice bridge for your meeting and use this new number. This number is then returned in the response of the create call.\n\nIf your voice bridge is already being used but by a meeting in a different server, then there’s no problem, the voice bridge you informed will be used.\n\nOverall, integrations should always check the response of the create call to see if the voice bridge passed in the parameters was the one actually used to create the meeting.\n\nGet Recordings\n\nWhat changed: Parameters were added to the API call.\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/getRecordings\n\nParameters:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Change\n      Param Name\n      When Returned\n      Type\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Added\n      meta\n      Optional\n      String\n      You can pass one or more metadata values to filter the recordings returned. If multiple metadata values are passed, will only return recordings that match all of them. The format of these parameters is the same as the metadata passed to the create call. For more information see this page\n    \n  \n\n\nNote: If multiple filtering parameters are used in conjunction (e.g. meta_ and meetingID), only recordings that match all of the parameters passed will be returned.\n\nExample Requests:\n\nhttp://yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/getRecordings?meta_presenter=joe&amp;meta_category=education&amp;checksum=1234\n\n\n\nGet Servers\n\nThis is a custom API call available only on the Load Balancer.\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/getServers\n\nDescription\n\nReturns a list of servers available in the Load Balancer with information about their status, geographic position and address.\n\nExample call:\n\nhttp://yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/getServers?checksum=146ad52c5c82b4d948b661eb87cf6c09bd2a73fa\n\n\n\nExample response:\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n  &lt;returncode&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/returncode&gt;\n  &lt;servers&gt;\n    &lt;server&gt; &lt;!-- a server that is enabled --&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;server1.org&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;address&gt;server1.org&lt;/address&gt;\n      &lt;url&gt;http://server1.org&lt;/url&gt;\n      &lt;apiUrl&gt;http://server1.org/bigbluebutton/api&lt;/apiUrl&gt;\n      &lt;status&gt;2&lt;/status&gt;\n      &lt;disableState&gt;2&lt;/disableState&gt;\n      &lt;geoloc&gt;\n        &lt;address&gt;server1.org&lt;/address&gt;\n        &lt;ip&gt;200.0.1.2&lt;/ip&gt;\n        &lt;countryCode&gt;BR&lt;/countryCode&gt;\n        &lt;countryCode3&gt;BRA&lt;/countryCode3&gt;\n        &lt;countryName&gt;Brazil&lt;/countryName&gt;\n        &lt;city&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/city&gt;\n        &lt;latitude&gt;-30.033300399780273&lt;/latitude&gt;\n        &lt;longitude&gt;-51.20000076293945&lt;/longitude&gt;\n        &lt;continentCode&gt;SA&lt;/continentCode&gt;\n      &lt;/geoloc&gt;\n      &lt;isDisabled&gt;false&lt;/isDisabled&gt;\n    &lt;/server&gt;\n    &lt;server&gt; &lt;!-- a server that is disabled --&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;server2.org&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;address&gt;server2.org&lt;/address&gt;\n      &lt;url&gt;http://server2.org&lt;/url&gt;\n      &lt;status&gt;2&lt;/status&gt;\n      &lt;disableState&gt;1&lt;/disableState&gt;\n      &lt;geoloc&gt;\n        &lt;address&gt;server2.org&lt;/address&gt;\n        &lt;ip&gt;81.0.1.2&lt;/ip&gt;\n        &lt;countryCode&gt;DE&lt;/countryCode&gt;\n        &lt;countryCode3&gt;DEU&lt;/countryCode3&gt;\n        &lt;countryName&gt;Germany&lt;/countryName&gt;\n        &lt;city&gt;Berlin&lt;/city&gt;\n        &lt;latitude&gt;50.033987987897&lt;/latitude&gt;\n        &lt;longitude&gt;13.20890898799&lt;/longitude&gt;\n        &lt;continentCode&gt;EU&lt;/continentCode&gt;\n      &lt;/geoloc&gt;\n      &lt;isDisabled&gt;true&lt;/isDisabled&gt;\n    &lt;/server&gt;\n  &lt;/servers&gt;\n&lt;response&gt;\n\n\n\nParameters\n\nThis call requires no parameters.\n\nTags in the response\n\nTags in the response:\n\n\n  \n    \n      parameter\n      type\n      meaning\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      name\n      string\n      The string used to identify this server in the Load Balancer\n    \n    \n      address\n      string\n      The IP or domain of the server\n    \n    \n      url\n      string\n      The full URL of the server, including protocol and port (if not a default port)\n    \n    \n      apiUrl\n      string\n      The full URL of the server including the API path. The URL that should be used to call API methods in this server.\n    \n    \n      status\n      integer\n      The status of the server in the monitoring system. Can be: 0 undefined; 1 pending (a request is being made); 2 up (the server is up and running); 3 down (the server is down); 4 unreachable (the server is unreachable). These statuses are based on the statuses of hosts on nagios.\n    \n    \n      disableState\n      boolean\n      The flag that controls whether the server is 0 forcibly enabled; 1 forcibly disabled; or 3 in automatic mode. Automatic mode means that the server will be automatically disabled if its monitoring information are indicating the load balancer to disable it (according to rules specified in the load balancer). For example, if the CPU load is higher than ~70% or if the server is not responding at all. The other modes are used by admins to forcibly enable or disable a server, ignoring the status of the services.\n    \n    \n      geoloc\n      -\n      A tag with nested tags including information about the geographic location of the server. This location is acquired from GeoIP using the server’s address. Any of its nested tags can be empty.

Notice that if disabledByLB is true, this will always be true as well, otherwise this can be either true (disabled by an admin) or false (the server is enabled). If you just need to know if the server is enabled or not and don’t need to know the reasons, use this flag.\n    \n  \n\n\nPossible failure responses\n\n\n  Invalid checksum (returns the standard response as returned by BigBlueButton/Mconf-Live, see an example in this section)\n  Unauthorized access (read this section)\n\n\nGet Meeting Events\n\nThis is a custom API call available only on the Load Balancer.\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/getMeetingEvents\n\nDescription\n\nReturns a list of meetings that happened during the period selected and the users that participated in these meetings.\n\nThis call requires no parameters. If no parameters are specified, the call will return the last 50 meetings that had at least 1 user in it.

See details in the table below.\n    \n    \n      query\n      -\n      A list of all the parameters passed to the create call when this meeting was created. Used specially to get additional metadata that was passed to the create call.\n    \n  \n\n\nTags inside &lt;users&gt;:\n\n\n  \n    \n      parameter\n      type\n      meaning\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      name\n      string\n      The name of the user, the same as fullName in a join call.\n    \n    \n      role\n      string\n      The role of the user in the meeting, one of the options: attendee, moderator.\n    \n    \n      createdAt\n      timestamp\n      The timestamp for when the user joined the meeting (when the join call was performed).\n    \n  \n\n\nNote: This call might return several &lt;user&gt; blocks for the same person in case that person joined the meeting several times. Each &lt;user&gt; block correspond to a join call, and will have a different createdAt than the other blocks for the same user.\n\nPossible failure responses\n\n\n  Invalid checksum (returns the standard response as returned by BigBlueButton/Mconf-Live, see an example in this section)\n  Unauthorized access (read this section)\n  Invalid parameter (see an example in this section)\n\n\nConfig XML\n\nCalls to set the config.xml in a web conference server are calls from Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton that are also implemented in the LB. There are a few differences in these calls when made to the LB that you should be aware of.\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/getDefaultConfigXML\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/setConfigXML\n\ngetDefaultConfigXML\n\nWill return the default config.xml file that can be used to customize any of the servers connected to the LB.\n\nDifferences from Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton\n\nIn the XML in the response, all URLs will be relative to the LB. So the response might include a tag like the one below:\n\n&lt;skinning enabled=\"true\" url=\"http://lb.mconf.org/client/branding/css/BBBDefault.css.swf\"/&gt;\n\n\n\nYou can see the URL pointing to http://lb.mconf.org/client/branding/css/BBBDefault.css.swf, even though this URL works only in Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton servers and will return an error if you try to access it in the LB. But this is not wrong. The LB will automatically adjust the XML back to the correct URLs on setConfigXML.\n\nsetConfigXML\n\nWill set a config.xml in the server that is holding the target meeting.\n\nDifferences from Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton\n\nThe LB expects to receive a config.xml where all URLs point to the address of the LB, not to the address of the target web conference server! Just like the config.xml returned by the LB on getDefaultConfigXML. It will then automatically adjust the URLs to the target server.\n\nAll calls: authorization\n\nWhat changed\n\nThe LB checks whether the 3rd-party application is allowed to perform the actions it is trying to perform in the API. In a create call, for example, if the parameter record is set to true, the LB will check if the 3rd-party application is actually allowed to record meetings or not. If it is, the call proceeds as normal. Otherwise the LB responds with an error message.\n\nAll API calls are subjected to this verification, so all of the API calls could return one of the errors described below.\n\nNew error responses\n\n\n  \n    \n      messageKey\n      message\n      When it happens?\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      permissionDenied\n      This application is not currently allowed to access this API.\n      General error for whenever the application has no access at all to the API.\n    \n    \n      permissionDenied\n      This application is not allowed to record meetings.\n      When a create call tries to record but the application is not allowed to.\n    \n    \n      permissionDenied\n      This application is not allowed to have any more concurrent meetings.\n      When a create call fails because the 3rd-party application already reached its limit in the number of concurrent meetings.\n    \n  \n\n\nExample of an error response\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n   &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n   &lt;messageKey&gt;permissionDenied&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n   &lt;message&gt;This application is not currently allowed to access this API.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nStandard error responses\n\nThis section contains examples of some standard error responses returned by the LB and, some of them, also by Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton. These are not all the possible error responses, just the most common ones.\n\nChecksum error\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n  &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n  &lt;messageKey&gt;checksumError&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n  &lt;message&gt;You did not pass the checksum security check.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nInvalid meetingID\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n  &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n  &lt;messageKey&gt;invalidMeetingIdentifier&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n  &lt;message&gt;The meeting ID that you supplied did not match any existing meetings.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nMissing meetingID\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n  &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n  &lt;messageKey&gt;missingParamMeetingID&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n  &lt;message&gt;You must specify a meeting ID for the meeting.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nInvalid parameters\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n  &lt;returncode&gt;FAILED&lt;/returncode&gt;\n  &lt;messageKey&gt;invalidParameters&lt;/messageKey&gt;\n  &lt;message&gt;The URL you supplied has parameters that are not accepted.&lt;/message&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;\n\n\n\nCurrent limitations\n\nThere’s currently no knowledge of anything from in the API of Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton that is not available in the API of the Load Balancer :thumbsup:\n\nIf you happen to come across anything missing in the API of the LB, please contact us.\n\n\n\nIn Development\n\nGet Meetings\n\nBase URL\n\n/bigbluebutton/api/getMeetings\n\nWhat changed\n\nInformation was added to the response. It includes the server in which the meeting is being held.\n\nExample response\n\n&lt;response&gt;\n   &lt;returncode&gt;SUCCESS&lt;/returncode&gt;\n   &lt;meetings&gt;\n     &lt;meeting&gt;\n       &lt;meetingID&gt;93b8fac2-1373658348&lt;/meetingID&gt;\n       &lt;meetingName&gt;My Meeting&lt;/meetingName&gt;\n       &lt;createTime&gt;1410298186908&lt;/createTime&gt;\n       &lt;attendeePW&gt;ap&lt;/attendeePW&gt;\n       &lt;moderatorPW&gt;mp&lt;/moderatorPW&gt;\n       &lt;hasBeenForciblyEnded&gt;false&lt;/hasBeenForciblyEnded&gt;\n       &lt;running&gt;true&lt;/running&gt;\n       &lt;participantCount&gt;2&lt;/participantCount&gt;\n       &lt;listenerCount&gt;0&lt;/listenerCount&gt;\n       &lt;videoCount&gt;0&lt;/videoCount&gt;\n       &lt;voiceBridge&gt;75992&lt;/voiceBridge&gt;\n       &lt;dialNumber&gt;613-123-1234&lt;/dialNumber&gt;\n       &lt;server&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n         &lt;name&gt;my-server.org&lt;/name&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n         &lt;address&gt;my-server.org&lt;/address&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n         &lt;url&gt;http://my-server.org&lt;/url&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n       &lt;/server&gt; &lt;!-- Added --&gt;\n     &lt;/meeting&gt;\n   &lt;/meetings&gt;\n&lt;/response&gt;"

						"content": "Mconf\n\nMconf is a project that aims to create a complete and easy to use web conference system, with focus on the integration with existent platforms and devices and on the interaction with mobile devices.\nIt is built on top of BigBlueButton, an open source web conference system.\n\nMconf is composed of several components, among them are Mconf-Live, a customized version of BigBlueButton that includes several new features, and Mconf-Web, a web portal where people can collaborate asynchronously, schedule and participate in web conferences.\n\nMconf started in the end of 2010 as a research project and after years of development Mconf grew to become a solid product. The main distinguishing points compared to other similar systems are (1) the possibility of integrating Mconf with practically any existent system, as shown by the several integrations that already exist (for Moodle and WordPress, for instance), (2) the open source nature of the project, and (3) the wide range of customizations that are possible (when used by an institution, Mconf can be modified to work as part of the institution’s infrastructure instead of acting as an external, separate web conference system).\n\nThe main open source components of Mconf are:\n\n\n  Mconf-Live, a customized version of BigBlueButton.\n  Mconf-Web, a web portal to create web conferences and interact with other people.\n  Mconf-Mobile, a mobile client to access web conferences from Android and iOS devices.\n\n\nResources\n\n\n  The source code for all projects that compose Mconf can be found at our GitHub page.\n  Bugs and tasks are also tracked on GitHub, in their respective projects. Issues on Mconf-Live, for example, are listed on Mconf-Live’s issue page on GitHub.\n  For feedbacks, suggestions and troubleshooting (or anything else you need), see our FAQ or contact us at our developer’s mailing list: mconf-dev@googlegroups.com\n  Found a bug or want to suggest a new feature? Go to our institution on GitHub, find the project you’re looking for and add a new issue.\n  Want to collaborate? Fork some of our repositories on GitHub and send a pull request!\n\n\nContributors\n\nMconf is started at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and is currently supported by Mconf Tecnologia. As a research project, it was developed in the research group PRAV and funded mainly by RNP.\n\nDocumentation of our subprojects\n\n\n  Mconf-Live: Here you can learn more about Mconf-Live, Mconf’s web conference application.\n  Mconf-Web: Mconf-Web is the web portal that provides access to web conferences.\n  Mconf-Mobile: Mconf-Mobile is a mobile implementation of a web conference client."

						"categories": "Archives",
						"url": " /archives/blog-new-issue-tracker-and-updates-on-mconf-org/",
						"content": "In the past weeks, Mconf’s issue tracking has been migrated from our old internal Redmine server (that used to be on the domain “dev.mconf.org”) to GitHub. We needed more stability and a centralized point for code, issues and wiki, and GitHub is great for that. We now make full use of issues and pull requests in GitHub for all of our projects.\n\nYou can find the list of issues for each project in their GitHub Page. The main projects are:\n\n\n  Mconf-Live: https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton/issues\n  Mconf-Web: https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/issues\n  Mobile client: https://github.com/mconf/bbb-air-client\n\n\nMoreover, a few days ago Mconf.org has received a few upgrades that improve both the web portal and the web conference backend. Here’s a short summary of what has been added in these updates.\n\nMconf-Web, the web portal, is now on version 2.2.0, a second update over the version 2.0.0 that was released a few months ago after several months of development. The latest update deployed to Mconf.org includes a few important things:\n\n\n  Removal of the features “private messages”, “news”, and “spam reporting”. These features were on Mconf-Web since it first started as a customized version of the open source software Global Plaza. With years of development and usage, we realized that they were very underused and/or were not designed in the way we wanted them to be. This update removes those features, that in the future might be recreated, redesigned and implemented in a way we believe to be more useful for the users. This is also aligned with the goal of making the application simpler and easier to use, since it removes things that were actually more of a distraction than anything.\n  Added translations to German and Spanish, thanks to the community of translator on Transifex!\n  Improvements in the speed of some pages, specially the list of spaces. This page used to load very slowly since there are thousands of spaces in Mconf.org, but now the queries were improved and it now loads as fast as any other page.\n  Several security fixes, bug fixes and code improvements in general. Upgraded libraries and refactoring of (usually old) code always results in gains in security and stability.\n\n\nAs for the web conference system, Mconf-Live, the development has also been going strong in the past months. The latest changes made available on Mconf.org are mostly back-end improvements, most of them related to the stability of the application. The biggest feature change in the past months is certainly the adoption of WebRTC for audio, that improved the quality of the conferences a lot.\n\nThe next version of Mconf-Live, to be released in the next few months, will be based on BigBlueButton 1.0, bringing with it all the features and improvements made on BigBlueButton 1.0 over 0.9 and still keeping all the features that are still unique to Mconf-Live.\n\nTo see more, sign in to your Mconf.org account (or create a new one) and try it out!\n\nIf you have comments or suggestions, reach us out on our contact page. For bugs and features, drop by our GitHub page to create an issue."

						"content": "We’ve recently release on Mconf.org’s YouTube channel a few of the first tutorial videos from a series of videos that is being created to teach users about all features available in Mconf.\n\nThe videos are meant to be short (up to around 5 minutes) and cover a single feature or use case. For example, there’s a video that shows how to share your microphone in a conference; another tutorial explains the roles users can have in a conference and what each role is allowed to.\n\nWe plan on adding several more videos to this playlist as they are finished. The list of topics to be covered includes (but is not restricted to):\n\n\n  How to access Mconf, change your profile, account and picture.\n  Creating a web conference, sending invitations and accessing conferences through an invitation.\n  Create spaces and create web conferences in spaces.\n  How to protect conferences with passwords.\n  User roles in a conference.\n  How to share your webcam and microphone.\n  Visualization and control of videos in a confernece.\n  Chat, sharing presentations and using the whiteboard.\n  Desktop sharing.\n  Changing and managing confernece layouts.\n  Recording a conference and watching recordings.\n  Moderation of conferences.\n\n\nCurrently the videos are only available in Portuguese, but we plan on releasing English subtitles for them in the future. If you would like to see these videos in another language, whether you’re able to contribute to the translation or not, let us know!\n\nThe playlist (Portuguese only) can be found below or you can also see it on YouTube.\n\n\n\nCheck out Mconf.org’s YouTube channel at: https://www.youtube.com/mconforg"

						"content": "Even though we”ve been absent for a long time (our last blog post is from two years ago), the development of Mconf has been going strong during all this time. We can even say it”s more active today than it has been in the first years of the project! A lot has happened in Mconf during this time. In the next few months, we”ll be trying to give you an update on all that”s happened. To start it, this post will give you a brief summary of the most relevant news and features that should be covered in more details in future posts.\n\nAs of the time of the last post in this blog, Mconf had a native Android application in development. Given a few issues we had with the application and specially due to the cost of maintaining it, we decided to stop its development in favor of a new mobile application that is being developed using the framework Adobe Air. This makes the mobile client a lot more similar to the web client (that uses Flash) and makes its development and maintenance easier. As a great bonus, Adobe Air also allows the application to run in iOS devices, so the mobile client will, in the future, run on both Android and iOS devices. This application is still in development in a combined effort of Mconf and BigBlueButton.\n\nIf you”re an old user of Mconf.org, you certainly also noticed some changes in the site in the past months. Both the landing page of Mconf.org and the web portal (that also runs on the domain mconf.org) were updated. The web portal is the software Mconf-Web, that has received a lot of updates in the past years. It is now very close to what we call version 2.0, a completely refactored version of the first web portal that was previously available on Mconf.org. It includes countless changes, both in the code and in the way it works and looks, most mobile casino of them aiming to make the application simpler, cleaner and more reliable. The landing page has also been updated to a more modern version, with a design that matches the new web portal, and a lot of its content was updated.\n\nAs for Mconf-Live, Mconf”s web conferencing module, the changes were also plentiful. We followed the upgrades in BigBlueButton (currently on version 0.9.1), and contributed to it, as you can see in the BigBlueButton and Mconf page. The new features on Mconf-Live include the ability to share multiple cameras, the options to promote users to moderators (or demote them to attendees) from inside a conference, the listen only mode, the shared notes module, the options to download presentations, chat and shared notes, the new options for user status, and the new webhooks module (phew phew). We should go into more details about them in future posts. Take a look below for a few pictures of some of these new features.\n\nSo that”s it for a brief summary of all that was done during past months. Expect to hear from us again soon!"

						"content": "A few months ago we”ve made a post about the API Mate, a tool to access the APIs of BigBlueButton and Mconf. It was said that it was based on an open source library called bigbluebutton-api-js, and even tough the API Mate was free to use on our website, the source code was tightly integrated with the code of mconf.org and was not open source.\n\nRecently we”ve made a few improvements on its interface and released it as a separate open source project. You can still use it for free without needing to setup anything (see the links below), but now you can also make your own changes and adapt it to your casino pa natet needs.\n\nThe API Mate is available at the following links:\n\n\n  Use it at: http://mconf.github.io/api-mate (you can also still use the old url: http://mconf.org/tools/api-mate)\n  The source code is on GitHub, at http://github.com/mconf/api-mate\n\n\nFeedbacks and comments (and pull requests!) are always welcome!"

					"archives-blog-guest-feature": {
						"id": "archives-blog-guest-feature",
						"title": "Blog post - Guest feature",
						"categories": "Archives",
						"url": " /archives/blog-guest-feature/",
						"content": "The “guest” feature was added to Mconf-Live at the end of the last year and it adds an important feature to the system: it allows a moderator to control who can access the meeting from within a meeting.\n\nWhen a guest user wants to join in the meeting he will need that a user with moderator privileges approve his entrance. If a meeting has more than one moderator, a guest pop-up window will appear in the top right side asking if you allow the new user to enter in the meeting. If there isn”t a moderator in the meeting, the system stores the list of users that are waiting permission to enter and show it as soon as a moderator joins.\n\nThe picture below is the moderator view when a guest tries to join:\n\n\n\nThe moderator can allow a user to enter clicking on the green button or deny his access by clicking on the red button. He can allow all the guests that are waiting clicking on “allow everyone” or deny them clicking on “deny everyone”.  He can also check the “remember” option, meaning that the same action casino online will be taken for the next users that try to join the meeting (useful to allow or deny everyone from now on).\n\nYou can change the default option that you chose clicking in the setting button.\n\n\n\nThe picture below shows the guest waiting screen:\n\n\n\nThe picture below shows the message that appear when the moderator denied access to the guest:\n\n\n\nImplementation details:\n\nWithout the guest feature, it”s the web application (or integration as usually called) that decides if a user has permissions to join a meeting. In Mconf this is done by Mconf-Web. With online casino the guest feature this is still valid, but now the web application can also tell the web conference server that the user can join the meeting but only after being explicitly accepted by a moderator.\n\nThe implementation of the guest feature was done by adding a new parameter to the “join” API call. This parameter is called “guest” and is optional. If present and set to “true”, the user joining the conference will be treated as a guest. If not present, the API will behave as it does today (i.e. the password will define if the user is a moderator or an attendee).\n\nThe passwords in the “join” API call are still used to define the role of the user, even if he is set as a guest. So if the API call has the moderator password and the parameter guest set, the user will “pre-join” the meeting, wait for a moderator to approve his entrance, and when he finally joins he will be a moderator (i.e. even moderators have to be approved when they are set as guests).\n\nIn Mconf-Web (and so in mconf.org) now only moderators will automatically join a meeting without being a guest. If a user is a normal attendee, he will be set as guest.\n\nYou can read more details about the changes in the API at our wiki: https://code.google.com/p/mconf/wiki/MconfLiveApiChanges#Join_Meeting"

						"title": "Blog post - Mconf-Live 0.3",
						"categories": "Archives",
						"url": " /archives/blog-mconf-live-0_3/",
						"content": "We are glad to announce a new version of Mconf-Live, which introduces two new features:\n\n\n  A new kind of participant that can only visualize the conference (but not transmit audio or video);\n  A first version of the network monitor.\n\n\nOn the previous version when a user wanted to hear the conference, he was forced to enable his microphone as well. In addition, when the user enables his microphone, the system creates a stream that goes from the client to the server, even if he doesn”t want to talk, just listen. The problem is that every new audio stream creates a server-side overhead, because FreeSWITCH (that handles all the audio processing) generates an outcoming stream for each incoming stream. Each outcoming stream is formed by all the incoming streams except the correspondent incoming stream. The independence among outcoming streams makes it possible to send audio messages to a specific user, such as “You are now muted”.\n\nThe audio architecture was designed for high interactive sessions, but it doesn”t fit well on sessions with a low number of interactions but with many users, such as webinars. In theory the current architecture can handle a large number of participants (depending on the hardware), but often you will notice audio artifacts on the session, which are generated during the mixing process.\n\nWith this scenario in mind we proposed a simple architectural modification. When the user joins a session, he will receive an audio stream that is the result of all the other users streams mixed – this audio stream is called global stream, or global audio. Only when the user wants to talk that he will click on the headset icon and then join the session as a speaker. Internally the user will leave the global audio and create two new streams, an incoming stream and an outcoming stream, just like it was on the previous architecture.\n\nThe modification proposed (and implemented on Mconf-Live 0.3) aims to make the system more scalable and to increase the audio quality. The scalability improvement is due to the removal of the overhead that was generated during the mixing process. In the new architecture, the FreeSWITCH server will mix a smaller number of streams, and it will reduce the processing power needed for it. The audio quality improvement is justified by the same reason: mixing a online casino smaller number of streams will reduce the probability of annoying artifacts.\n\nA side-effect of the proposed architecture is that the user is able to open an incoming stream without opening an outcoming stream. It will reduce by 50% the bandwith requirement to listen an audio session, making the system more friendly to low bandwidth connections.\n\nThe UI will remain almost the same, except by two aspects. First, the “Listeners” window now will show the users with the microphone activated, so it will be a “Speakers” window. Last, we added a new button on the toolbar that mutes or unmutes the user”s speakers (see the figure below). Since the user will join the session and start listening automatically with no action required, we had to create a mechanism to mute this audio. The effect of this button is local only – the other users will continue listening normally.\n\n\n\nWe are introducing also on Mconf-Live 0.3 a network monitor. The ability to watch how much bandwidth is being consumed by the system and the latency between the client and the server may help users to identify the reasons for a low quality experience. The bandwidth data is presented at the bottom of the screen and is updated each couple of seconds, and if the user places his mouse over the data, a more detailed window is presented with the bandwidth consumption and latency. This is a preliminary development, and it should evolve on next iterations.\n\n\n\nA test server was set up for the users to test the new version before the final deployment to the Mconf Network, it”s available on http://lab1.mconf.org and the source code is available on GitHub. Any feedback is appreciated, hope you enjoy it!"

						"content": "A while ago, a tool called API Buddy (see more about it here and here, and access the application here) was developed by Omar Shamas to help in the access to BigBlueButton”s API. It has been extremely useful for us during development and also for the monitoring of our servers.\n\nA few months ago we developed a similar application that was integrated in our load balancer. Since it”s tightly integrated with the load balancer and our network”s infrastructure, it is only available to administrators. But today we are releasing it for everyone to use!\n\nThe application is available in the link below and it follows the same idea of the API Buddy: it provides links to all API calls casino online in a BigBlueButton or Mconf-Live server. To avoid confusion, the application was named API Mate — another idea borrowed from the API Buddy :)\n\n\n  Access the API Mate here\n\n\n\n\nIt has a few things more than the API Buddy though:\n\n\n  Updated with all calls in BigBlueButton 0.8 (recordings, for instance).\n  The user casino online can set “meta_” parameters or even any other custom parameter you might need (useful when developing something new in the API).\n  Has links to the mobile API and links to join a conference from Mconf-Mobile or BBB-Android (links with the protocol “bigbluebutton://”).\n  The interface is more dynamic: the links are automatically updated when the parameters are updated by the user.\n\n\nMoreover, the API Mate was developed using a small javascript library that we called bigbluebutton-api-js. In short, it is a library that gets the address and the salt of your web conference server and returns links to all API calls possible. Getting the links, you just need to show them in an interface such as the API Mate”s. This library is open source and it”s available on GitHub.\n\n\n\nWe hope this tool will be as useful for other people as it is being to us. Ideas and suggestions for improvement are always welcome, of course!"

						"content": "We are proud to present our brand new website that introduces Mconf”s new visual identity! This website will be an organized repository for all types of content related to Mconf, with explanations about the project, informations about the components that build the system as a whole, news, and any other information that might be relevant to the community. And also, as you can see, we now have a blog!\n\nIn the following posts in this blog we will show you what”s happening in Mconf today and what are our plans for the future. But for now, let”s just take a look at our new website. One of the reasons it was created was to remove content that”s specific for Mconf from our web portal (Mconf-Web), that aims to be a generic application for anyone that wants to use BigBlueButton. Pages such as “contact us” and “informations about the Mconf network” were moved to this new website you’re seeing now.\n\nThe content you can find today in this website is the basic structure for what will be added in the future. In the main page we have an overview with a demo where you can test Mconf and take a look at all its features. It also points to the Mconf Portal, the social network that provides access to Mconf and aggregates our communities and users.\n\nCurrently, most of the content in this site is located in the about section, such as the page that explains the concept of the Mconf global network and the pages with resources and publications. Also, if you want to know the people behind Mconf you can check our team page and maybe contact us directly.\n\nAnd, at last, this change happened at the same time another major change is happening: our headquarter was moved to a new lab to accommodate the new members that will be joining our team very soon!"
