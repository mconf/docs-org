Mconf-Live is a software based on BigBlueButton, which makes its API very similar to (and compatible with) BigBlueButton's API. Therefore it supports everything that BigBlueButton supports, with a few modifications and additions. See:

* BigBlueButton's API: <http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html>
* Mconf-Live's API: <https://github.com/mconf/wiki/wiki/Mconf-Live-API>
